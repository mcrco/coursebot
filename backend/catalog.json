        "content": "In September of 1891, Pasadena philanthropist Amos G. Throop (pronounced\nTroop) established Throop University, the institution that would eventually\nbecome Caltech.\n\nThroop University opened its doors with 31 students and a six-member faculty.\nThroop might have remained simply a good local school had it not been for the\narrival in Pasadena of astronomer George Ellery Hale. The first director of\nthe Mount Wilson Observatory, Hale became a member of Throop\u2019s board of\ntrustees in 1907 and began molding the school into a first-class institution\nfor engineering and scientific research and education.\n\nHale would be joined later by chemist Arthur A. Noyes and physicist Robert A.\nMillikan. By 1920, the school had been renamed the California Institute of\nTechnology, and the enrollment was nine graduate students and 359\nundergraduates, with a faculty of 60; a decade later there were 138 graduate\nstudents, 510 undergraduates, and a faculty of 180. At the present time there\nare some 1,000 undergraduates, 1,400 graduate students, 300 professorial\nfaculty, and more than 600 postdoctoral scholars.\n\nCaltech has more than 25,000 living alumni all over the world, many of them\neminent in their fields of engineering, science, law, medicine, academia,\nentrepreneurship, and more.\n\nCaltech\u2019s divisional structure, which began to coalesce in 1926, today\ncomprises the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering (BBE); the\nDivision of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering (CCE); the Division of\nEngineering and Applied Science (EAS); the Division of Geological and\nPlanetary Sciences (GPS); the Division of the Humanities and Social Sciences\n(HSS); and the Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy (PMA).

        "content": "Students at Caltech work toward undergraduate and graduate degrees alongside\ntheir intellectual equals in an academic environment that emphasizes\ninterdisciplinary teamwork, critical thinking, mutual support, and a deep\nunderstanding of core concepts and principles across fields.\n\nCaltech students, faculty, and postdoctoral scholars are addressing\nfundamental scientific questions and pressing societal challenges. Together,\nthey are expanding our understanding of the universe, shifting paradigms,\nlaunching new fields, and inventing the technologies of the future.\n\nCaltech is home to more than 50 research centers and institutes. Some 90\npercent of Caltech undergraduates participate in research during their time\nhere.\n\n##  UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH\n\nCaltech offers undergraduates 26 majors (called \u201coptions\u201d) and 17 minors\nacross the six academic divisions. The most popular options are computer\nscience, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering,\nand physics. Caltech also offers interdisciplinary programs in applied\nphysics, biochemistry, bioengineering, computation and neural systems, control\nand dynamical systems, environmental science and engineering, geobiology and\nastrobiology, geochemistry, and planetary astronomy.\n\nThe Institute offers the opportunity for qualified students to engage in\nresearch early in their careers under the supervision of a faculty member.\nThere are four principal avenues for undergraduate research: the senior\nthesis, the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) program, research\ncourses for academic credit, and research for pay under a faculty member\u2019s\ngrant or contract.\n\nThe senior thesis involves original research under the mentorship of a faculty\nmember, an effort that develops research, writing, and presentation skills\nthat together provide an excellent preparation for future graduate studies\nand/or professional life.\n\nThe SURF program provides continuing undergraduate students the opportunity to\nwork on an individual research project in a tutorial relationship with a\nmentor, usually a member of the Caltech/JPL research community, but\noccasionally a faculty member at another college or university. The work is\ncarried out during a 10-week period in the summer, after which SURF students\nsubmit a written report describing the project, methods, and results of their\nwork.\n\nMost options offer undergraduate research courses in order to encourage\nresearch participation during the academic year; students should consult\nlistings and descriptions of opportunities.\n\nIn some circumstances, faculty will hire students to conduct research.\nStudents should discuss this option with a prospective mentor. Students with\nwork-study financial aid should also contact Caltech\u2019s Career Achievement,\nLeadership, and Exploration (CALE) about how to apply funding to research\npositions.\n\nLearn more about undergraduate programs and research at sfp.caltech.edu/.\n\n##  GRADUATE PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH\n\nStudents can enroll in Master of Science, Degree of Engineer, Doctor of\nPhilosophy, BS/MS, and MD/PhD degree programs; the majority of graduate\nstudents are enrolled in the PhD program.\n\nThe academic work of the Institute is organized into six divisions: Biology\nand Biological Engineering ([bbe.caltech.edu](http://bbe.caltech.edu));\nChemistry and Chemical Engineering\n([cce.caltech.edu](http://cce.caltech.edu)); Engineering and Applied Science\n([eas.caltech.edu](http://eas.caltech.edu)); Geological and Planetary Sciences  \n([gps.caltech.edu](http://gps.caltech.edu)); Humanities and Social Sciences\n([hss.caltech.edu](http://hss.caltech.edu)); and Physics, Mathematics and\nAstronomy ([pma.caltech.edu](http://pma.caltech.edu)).\n\nGraduate study at the Institute is divided further into a number of individual\ngraduate options (degree programs), which are supervised by those professors\nwhose interests and research are closely related to the area of the option.\nEntering graduate students are admitted into one of these options. The most\npopular options for graduate work are chemistry, physics, electrical\nengineering, and biology. Learn more at\n[gradoffice.caltech.edu](http://gradoffice.caltech.edu).\n\n##  ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS\n\nCaltech maintains an array of external partnerships with other institutions in\nSouthern California. These partnerships provide pre-med students with\nopportunities to work in area hospitals and train with practicing clinicians;\nallow students to participate in ROTC through a joint program with USC; and\noffer a 3/2 dual degree for students from 13 select liberal-arts colleges.\nCaltech undergraduate students can cross-register at Occidental College and\nArt Center College of Design, and the Institute maintains relations with\nresearch partners such as the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UCSD.\nUndergraduate students can also study abroad in Cambridge, Copenhagen,\nEdinburgh, London, Paris, Melbourne, or the University of Chicago during their\njunior or senior years For graduate students, joint programs between Caltech\nand both the USC Keck School of Medicine and the UCLA David Geffen School of\nMedicine grant MD/PhD degrees.\n\n##  FACULTY RESEARCH\n\nThe contributions of Caltech\u2019s faculty have earned national and international\nrecognition.

        "content": "##  Undergraduate Student Residences\n\nSeven of the undergraduate student residences are situated on either side of\nthe Olive Walk near the southeastern end of the campus. The original\nfour\u2014Blacker, Dabney, Fleming, and Ricketts\u2014were built in 1931 from the plans\nof Mr. Gordon B. Kaufmann, in the Mediterranean style to harmonize with the\nadjacent Athenaeum. The other three, designed by Smith, Powell and Morgridge,\nwere completed in 1960, and are named Lloyd, Page, and Venerable.\n\nEach of these seven residences is a separate unit with its own dining room and\nlounge, providing accommodations for between 65 and 100 students, depending on\nthe facility. Each has its own elected officers; a long history of shared\ngovernance gives students the ability to represent their needs in their own\nliving environments. Residential Life Coordinators (RLCs) are specially\ntrained full-time university employees specializing in college student\ndevelopment, community building, counseling, and crisis intervention. The RLCs\nsupervise the Resident Associates (RAs) on programming and overall student\nwellness. The RLCs also assist Housing with the management and daily\noperations of the residences. Each residence has one or more RA, who are\ntypically graduate students. Mail is delivered daily to the student mailboxes.\nStudents should use their mailbox number, California Institute of Technology,\nPasadena, CA 91126, to facilitate handling of mail at the campus post office.\nFor more information, please visit\n[housing.caltech.edu](https://housing.caltech.edu).\n\n###  Avery House\n\nMade possible by a gift from trustee R. Stanton Avery, this undergraduate\nresidence and innovative residential complex was designed by Moore, Ruble,\nYudell, and completed in September 1996. Located at the north end of the\ncampus, Avery has an RLC, two RAs, two faculty apartments, and rooms for about\n136 undergraduates. Its dining facilities, meeting rooms, lounges, and library\nare designed to encourage informal faculty-student interaction and to attract\nall members of the campus community to join in this interaction. Avery hosts\nprograms and social events that facilitate involvement between residents and\nfaculty in residence.\n\n###  Bechtel Residence\n\nEstablished in the fall of 2018 and located at the northeast edge of campus,\nthe Bechtel Residence is the first residence to open on campus since 1996.\nBechtel is named in honor of Caltech life trustee Stephen D. Bechtel, Jr., the\nfounder of the S. D. Bechtel Foundation.\n\nThe 95,000-square-foot residence is a multigenerational residence open to all\nundergraduates with: 211 student bedrooms arranged as singles and in suites;\nsix RA and one RLC apartments; and two faculty-in-residence apartments.\nBechtel was intentionally designed to provide the community with the greatest\nflexibility to maximize space as well as to encourage broader interaction,\nengagement, and residential life programming among residents. The facility\nincludes three kitchens; eight common areas/study rooms; several laundry\nrooms; a 400-seat dining hall and servery; and support spaces.\n\n###  Summer Housing\n\nCaltech will extend a License Contract to those individuals who satisfy the\nfollowing criteria: (1) they have been approved by the Housing Office and the\nUndergraduate Dean\u2019s Office; (2) they are eligible to enroll for the upcoming\nFall Term by no later than the June UASH meeting; and (3) they are in good\nstanding with both the Bursar\u2019s Office and the Institute overall. Individuals\nmust satisfy this criteria for the duration of the License Contract. If a\nCaltech student becomes ineligible to enroll, or is no longer in good standing\nwith the Bursar\u2019s Office, or in good standing with the Institute, or in good\nstanding with their Institute-approved summer program, their License Contract\nwill be automatically revoked. UASH meeting dates and petition deadlines can\nbe found at [registrar.caltech.edu/current-\nstudents/uash](https://registrar.caltech.edu/current-students/uash).\n\n##  Student Resources and Activities\n\n###  Hameetman Center\n\nThe Hameetman Center, which opened in 2019, is a new campus center built on\nthe site of the former Winnett Student Center. The Hameetman Center replaces\nWinnett as Caltech\u2019s central community gathering place. The 24,000-square-foot\ntwo-story center is named in honor of the Hameetman Foundation and Caltech\ntrustee Fred Hameetman (BS \u201962) and his wife, Joyce, who provided the initial\nfunding to initiate the design of the reimagined campus hub. It features a\nlarge public lounge, an expanded Red Door Marketplace, the Caltech Store,\nmusic rehearsal facilities, student club rooms, a multipurpose room, and a\nconference room. The rehearsal facility is made possible thanks to a gift from\nEmeritus Professor of Theoretical Physics Steven Frautschi and his wife, Mie.\n\n###  Student Experience\n\nThe Office of Student Experience (OSE) has responsibility for the oversight of\nCaltech\u2019s residential programs, including programs carried out in the\nundergraduate houses, graduate student residences, and the Bechtel and Marks-\nBraun communities. The OSE works collaboratively with the Residential Life\nCoordinators, Resident Associates, the Interhouse Committee, and other groups\nto ensure that student leaders in all our residential communities are trained\nand that there are programs in place to support their development. This is\npart of the shared governance that is central to the Caltech residential\nexperience. The residential experience also includes member of the faculty who\nlive in the undergraduate residences. The Faculty in Residence (FIR) Team\nestablishes an academic life and culture in Bechtel and Avery House. FIRs\nbridge the classroom experience by hosting regular conversations over dinner\nand develop specialized academic programing, which can include:\nextracurricular activities, tours and excursions, cooperative community\nservice projects, special events, and guest speaker programs.\n\nAll residences and houses, including all their activities and programs, are\nexpected to comply with Institute policies, Student Affairs policies, and the\nCaltech Code of Conduct. Potential Policy or Code of Conduct violations by a\nhouse or residence will be referred to the Caltech Routing committee. If the\nRouting Committee determines that the incident(s) is part of a Residential or\nHouse program or activity, it will be referred to OSE for further action. In\nthis case, the Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs and Student\nExperience (AVP) or designee, will either (a) manage the situation directly\nwith the community so the concerns can be addressed, or (b) initiate an\ninvestigation into the incident. If an investigation is conducted, the\ninvestigators will report their findings to the AVP who will make a decision\nconcerning whether any violations occurred and any consequences that may be\nimposed. The decision of the AVP may be appealed to the Vice President for\nStudent Affairs within 10 days of the decision.\n\nDuring the investigation, the AVP can suspend activities of the house or\nresidence until further notice if deemed necessary for the health, safety, or\nthe other benefit of the community. A range of outcomes may be considered as\nconsequences to the house or residence if the group is found to have engaged\nin a policy violation. Possible sanctions including community education and/or\nsuspension of the activity or event. Examples of events that warrant a\nresponse include an unregistered event or party, mistreatment of members, and\nhazing.

The adviser follows the first-year student\u2019s\nprogress and provides advice on any questions or problems that the student may\nhave.\n\n###  Option Advisers\n\nEach member of the three undergraduate upper classes is assigned an option\nadviser, a faculty member in the option in which the student is enrolled. The\nadviser takes an interest in the student\u2019s selection of courses and progress\ntoward a degree, and, eventually, in assisting the student toward satisfactory\nplacement in industry or in graduate school. Normally, the association between\nstudent and adviser is established before the beginning of the sophomore year\nand continues through graduation.\n\n###  Athletics, Physical Education, & Recreation (APER)\n\nCaltech supports an extensive program of competitive athletics. As a member of\nNCAA Division III and the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic\nConference, Caltech participates in intercollegiate competition in 20\nsports\u201410 each for men and women.

Members of the IHC are\nexpected to be enrolled and in good standing, both academically (eligible, and\nnot on probation) and disciplinarily (not on probation), during their tenure\nin office. The IHC works in conjunction with the APER department to conduct\nintramural competitions as described above, and conducts its own Discobolus\nTrophy competition, in which a house may challenge the house holding the\ntrophy to a mutually agreed upon contest.\n\n###  ASCIT\n\nThe undergraduate student body forms the membership of a corporation known as\nthe Associated Students of the California Institute of Technology, Inc., or\nASCIT. Governed by a board of directors consisting of six elected officers, it\nis involved in many aspects of student life; oversees publication of The Tech,\nour undergraduate student newspaper; the Big T yearbook; a literary magazine\ncalled Totem; and the Little t, which provides lots of helpful information to\nincoming students. A directory, along with other student information, such as\ncampus positions, links to the Interhouse Committee (IHC) and Academics and\nResearch Committee (ARC), and other helpful information is available online at\n[donut.caltech.edu](http://Donut.caltech.edu).\n\nBesides overseeing student publications and coordinating activities and\npolicies, the ASCIT Board of Directors administers the corporation\u2019s finances.\nASCIT sponsors a wide variety of special-interest clubs and programs, working\nclosely with Student Activities and Programs part of the Office of Student\nExperience. The student government is active in campus affairs. The student\nmembers of standing faculty committee ensure that undergraduate opinion is\nconsidered seriously. Excellent informal relations between students and\nfaculty and between students and administration promote discussion of mutual\nconcern and goodwill. Student-faculty conferences are held every other year\nand serve to promote communication mainly around academic topics.\n\n###  Graduate Student Council\n\nThe Graduate Student Council (GSC) is the student government for Caltech\ngraduate students. It is the mission of the GSC to maximize the quality of\nlife for the graduate student community at Caltech. The GSC Board of Directors\ninteracts with the Institute\u2019s administrative bodies and is formed of\nsubcommittees dedicated to academic support, advocating graduate student\nissues, sharing student news, and organizing social events.\n\n###  Student Leadership Expectations\n\nGraduate and undergraduate student leaders who are in either elected or\nappointed positions must be enrolled and in good standing with the Institute.\n\n###  Honor System\n\nThe Honor Code, embodied in the phrase \u201cNo member shall take unfair advantage\nof any other member of the Caltech community,\u201d is the fundamental principle of\nconduct for all students and extends to all phases of campus life, including\nscholastic and extracurricular activities, relations among students, and\nrelations between students and faculty. The Honor System is the most important\ntradition of the undergraduate student body. The Board of Control (Board),\nwhich is composed of elected student representatives, is charged with\nmonitoring the academic Honor System for undergraduates, investigating course\nwork violations, and making recommendations to the dean of undergraduate\nstudents. The purpose, composition, duties, and procedures of the Board, as\nwell as the roles and responsibilities of the deans, faculty, vice president\nfor student affairs, complainants (students reporting suspected violations),\nrespondents (those against whom an allegation of an academic Honor System\nviolation is made), witnesses, and other participants in the process, are set\nforth in Article XIII of the Associated Students of the California Institute\nof Technology bylaws.\n\nThe Conduct Review Committee, composed of students, faculty, and staff, hears\ncases involving non-academic Honor Code and Institute policy violations for\nundergraduate students, and also makes recommendations to the dean. At their\ndiscretion, the dean of undergraduate students, or their designee, may\ndirectly handle a matter also involving the Honor System, the Code of Conduct,\nand Institute Policies for undergraduate students. The Honor Code Handbook, a\nresource for undergraduate students, is available online at\n[deans.caltech.edu/HonorCode](https://deans.caltech.edu/HonorCode).\n\nThe Honor System is also an important part of graduate student life. The dean\nof graduate studies is responsible for reviewing and making decisions\nconcerning alleged Honor Code violations with respect to course-work. The\nGraduate Honor Council (GHC) serves as a consultative resource to the dean. At\ntheir discretion, the dean of graduate studies may request that the GHC\ninvestigate and hear a case, and provide its recommendations to the dean for\nfinal review and decision. All Members of the Graduate Honor Council must be\nin good standing with the Office of Graduate Studies and must attend a formal\ntraining before they may serve on a case. Examples of Honor Code violations\ninclude, but are not limited to, plagiarism, violations of the collaboration\npolicy in a class, and/or using resources that were strictly prohibited for\nhomework and/or exams. Incidents that are not handled by the dean of graduate\nstudies include accusations of research misconduct, which are handled by the\nOffice of Research Compliance; grade disputes, which are handled by the office\nof the provost. Institute Policy violations are handled by the office of the\ndean of graduate studies or the appropriate administrative organization.\n\n###  Student Body Publications\n\nThe publications of the student body include a weekly paper, _The California\nTech_ ; an undergraduate research journal, _CURJ_ ; a literary magazine,\n_Totem_ ; a student handbook, the _Little t_ , which gives a survey of student\nactivities and organizations and serves as a campus directory; a yearbook,\n_Big T_ ; an online undergraduate research opportunities handbook, _UROH_ ;\nand Caltech Letters, an online campus publication designed to let students\ntalk about their research and their viewpoints on science with the broader\nworld. These publications, staffed entirely by students, provide an\nopportunity for interested students to obtain valuable experience in creative\nwriting, photography, artwork, reporting and editing, advertising, and\nbusiness management.\n\n###  Performing and Visual Arts\n\nThe Institute provides directors and facilities for choirs, concert band, jazz\nband, symphony orchestra, numerous chamber music ensembles, guitar classes, a\ntheater program, ceramics and studio arts classes. These activities are\ncentered in the Music and Theater Arts houses on Hill Avenue along the eastern\nedge of campus.\n\n###  Student Clubs\n\nAll student clubs must be officially recognized in order to be in and remain\nin good standing with the Institute. To become officially recognized, the club\nmust annually apply for recognition. You will find details regarding this\nprocess outlined in the Student Club Handbook, which is available on the\nOffice of Student Experience website\n([ose.caltech.edu](https://ose.caltech.edu)).\n\nOnce the club is officially recognized, it may plan on maintaining that\nrecognition for the duration of the current academic year. The details of how\nto remain in good standing with the Institute are outlined in detail within\nthe Student Club Handbook. These details include club oversight, privileges,\nresponsibilities, finances, and other very important information. A recognized\nclub will receive the following privileges: the ability to recruit members;\nadvertise events; secure funding; conduct officer elections; provide trainings\nand use Institute facilities for meetings and events. Additional, key elements\nof club recognition include but are not limited to, having an advisor, an\nappropriate purpose, and a leadership infrastructure. Note that only\nrecognized clubs will be allowed to participate in the annual Club Fair.\n\nClubs at Caltech are expected to follow Institute policy, Student Affairs\npolicies, and the Caltech Code of Conduct. Potential policy or Code of Conduct\nviolations by a club or in connection with a club event will be referred to\nthe Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs and Student Experience (AVP)\nor their designee, will either (a) manage the issue with the club through an\nappropriate Institute response, or (b) initiate an investigation into the\nincident. If an investigation is conducted, the investigators will report\ntheir findings to the AVP who will make a decision concerning whether any\nviolations occurred and any consequences that may be imposed. The decision of\nthe AVP may be appealed to the vice president for student affairs within 10\ndays of the decision.\n\nDuring the investigation, the AVP may suspend the club\u2019s recognition and\nplanned activities, if deemed necessary, for the health, safety, or other\nbenefit of the community. A range of outcomes may be considered as\nconsequences to the club if the group is found to have engaged in a policy\nviolation. Possible sanctions examples include education, suspension of some\nor all of the group\u2019s privileges, or loss of their recognition status with the\nInstitute. If the potential situation also includes a potential policy\nviolation involving an individual student(s), the student(s) will be referred\nto the appropriate Dean\u2019s office and may be subject to disciplinary action.\n\n###  Caltech Center for Inclusion & Diversity (CCID)\n\nThe Caltech Center for Inclusion & Diversity (CCID) mission is to provide\neducation, advocacy, and allyship in order to increase institutional and\npersonal capacity for diversity and ensure a community committed to equity and\ninclusive excellence.

        "content": "All permanent grades recorded for first-year students in Core classes during\nthe first and second terms they are enrolled will be either P, indicating\n\u201cpassed,\u201d or F, indicating \u201cfailed.\u201d The temporary grade of I (\u201cincomplete\u201d)\nmay be used as it is for other students. The temporary grade of E may be given\nto first-year students as described below for other students. It may also be\nused in a continuing course if the performance of the first-year student\nconcerned is not significantly below the current passing level, and if the\nstudent is maintaining a steady and substantial improvement; an E given for\nthis reason will be automatically changed to an appropriate grade if the\nfirst-year student earns the grade for the following term, and will change to\nan F if the student receives an F for the following term. The grade may not be\nused in this way for two successive terms nor for the last term of the course.\n\nIf a first-quarter or second-quarter First-Year student is enrolled in a\ncourse from the list of introductory courses below and the instructor for that\ncourse gives letter grades, then the registrar will record P for all passing\ngrades. No grades given to a First-Year student for such a class during the\nfirst and second quarter in which they are enrolled will be used in computing\nthe cumulative grade-point average. Computation of grade-point averages begins\nat the end of the third term of the first year; the cumulative grade-point\naverage will include any letters grades received for non-Core non-introductory\nclasses taken for letter grades during the first two terms of the first year.\n\nThe list of introductory courses to which this policy applies is:\n\n  * Bi 8\n  * Ma 2\n  * Ma 3\n  * Ph 2ab\n  * Ph 12ab\n  * Ch 41ab\n\nClasses that are not part of the Core curriculum or the list of introductory\nclasses above, even if taken in the first two quarters of the first year, can\nonly count towards fulfilling graduation requirements if their grading scheme\nmeets the requirement of the particular option.\n\nFor example suppose a student wants to fulfill their graduation requirements\nfor the Computer Science (CS) option. In that case, they cannot take a CS\ncourse that is not part of the Core curriculum as pass/fail and use it to meet\nthe requirements for the option. This is because the CS option prohibits\npass/fail grading schemes for fulfilling its requirements. As a result, the\nstudent must take the CS course for a grade if they wish to fulfill the CS\noption requirement.\n\nFirst-quarter and second-quarter First-Year students receive pass/fail grades\nin all Core and introductory courses listed by virtue of their classification\nas First-Year students by an admissions committee or, for students whose\nstatus after the first year is uncertain, by the Undergraduate Academic\nStandards and Honors Committee.\n\nFor all students beyond the first and second quarters of their first year (as\na first-year student), graduate and undergraduate, letter grades will\nordinarily be used to indicate the character of the student\u2019s work: A,\nexcellent; B, good; C, satisfactory; D, poor; E, conditional; F, failed; I,\nincomplete. P may also be used as described below under Pass/Fail Grading. In\naddition, grades of A+ and A\u2013, B+ and B\u2013, C+ and C\u2013, and D+ may be used. In\nany situation in which no grade is reported, the grade shall be assumed to be\nF.\n\n_Failed._ Means that no credit will be recorded for the course. The units,\nhowever, count in computing the student\u2019s grade-point average, unless the\ncourse was taken on a pass/fail basis. The student may register to repeat the\nsubject in a subsequent term and receive credit without regard to the previous\ngrade, the new grade and units being counted as for any other course, but the\noriginal F and units for the course remain on the record. Grades other than E,\nI, and W are assumed to be based on work completed and evaluated at the time\nof grade submission.\n\n##  E and I Grades\n\n_E Grades._ At their discretion, instructors may give students who have not\ncompleted their work for a course by the end of the term a grade of E. The\ngrade E indicates deficiencies that may be made up without repeating the\ncourse. If the instructor does not specify a date on the grade report sheet\nfor completion of the work, students receiving an E will have until Add Day of\nthe following term to complete their work for that course. Instructors may,\nhowever, require the work for the course to be completed by an earlier date.\nIn addition, students should be aware that E grades can impact ability to meet\neligibility requirements. If an E grade impacts a student\u2019s academic standing,\nthe grade may be due by the first day of classes. See section Scholastic\nRequirements for additional information.\n\nIf a student receives an E and does not complete the work by the date\nspecified by the instructor or by Add Day (or a different date specified by\nthe instructor), the grade will be changed to an F. Adequate time must be\nafforded to instructors to grade the work and to submit the final grade to the\nregistrar.\n\nIt is the responsibility of a student receiving an E to confirm that the\nregistrar has recorded the terms for satisfying the completion of the work in\nthe course.\n\nWith the written permission of the instructor, a student may extend the E\ngrade past Add Day of the following term, but doing so will cause an\nadditional E grade to be registered. Each additional extension of the E will\nbe until the date specified by the instructor or until Add Day of the\nfollowing term, but in each case will require the written permission of the\ninstructor and the registering of an additional E grade.\n\n_E Count Limitations._ After an undergraduate student has been awarded the\ngrade of E six times, they are not eligible to receive E grades in any\nsubsequent term. A petition for an E in a subsequent term may be approved by\nthe Undergraduate Academic Standards and Honors (UASH) Committee in an\nexceptional case. Such a petition requires the support of the instructor and\nthe dean or associate dean of undergraduate students.\n\n_I Grades._ The grade I is given only in case of unexpected sickness or other\nemergency, occuring near the end of the term, that impedes the completion of\nthe work in the class. An I grade is not intended to allow students to make up\nmissed work from the majority of the term. If a student has not completed the\nmajority of the work, they are not eligible for an incomplete and they will be\nadvised to late drop the class or take a leave. It is given at the discretion\nof the instructor, after approval by the dean or associate dean of students or\nthe dean of graduate studies. If a student is seeking an I grade due to a\nsevere exacerbation or onset of a disability that occurred near the end of the\nterm, they should contact Caltech Accessibility Services for Students (CASS)\nat [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).\n\nThe time period within which the grade of I is to be made up should be\nindicated on the grade sheet, or students receiving an I will have until Add\nDay of the following term to complete their work for the course. In addition,\nstudents should be aware that I grades can impact ability to meet eligibility\nrequirements. If an I grade impacts a student\u2019s academic standing, the grade\nmay be due by the first day of classes. See section Scholastic Requirements\nfor additional information.\n\nStudents receiving grades of E or I should consult with their instructors, and\none of the deans, at the time of issue regarding the work required and the\ntime allowed. This time should, in most cases, coincide with the date fixed in\nthe calendar for removal of conditions and incompletes (Add Day), and in fact\nif no other time is specified, this date will be assumed. However, except\nunder extraordinary circumstances, the time for the completion of the work\nwill not be extended beyond one year after the date in which the grade of E or\nI was given. In the absence of an earlier deadline, an E will turn into an F\none year after the date on which the E was given, and an I grade will turn\ninto a W (standing for \u201cwithdrawn\u201d) one year after the date on which the I\ngrade was given. For undergraduates, waiving of this one year rule is done in\nonly the most exceptional of circumstances and requires the agreement, before\nthat one year anniversary, of the Dean of Undergraduate Students, chair of\nUASH, and executive officer of the department in which the course was taken.\nFor graduate students, a change may be made only with the approval of the Dean\nof Graduate Studies, in consultation with the Graduate Studies Committee.\n\nGrades of E and I shall not be considered in calculating a student\u2019s grade-\npoint average.\n\n##  Petitions and Exceptions\n\nOnce recorded, a grade will only be changed on the basis of error. For\nundergraduates, a change may be made only with the approval of the\nUndergraduate Academic Standards and Honors Committee. For graduate students,\na change may be made only with the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies,\nin consultation with the Graduate Studies Committee as appropriate.\n\nPetitions by undergraduate students for late drops (i.e., requests to drop a\ncourse after Drop Day) will be considered by the UASH Committee, but will only\nbe approved if circumstances beyond the student\u2019s control prevented them from\ndropping a course or courses by the posted deadline. Such petitions must be\nsubmitted before the end of the term following the term when the course was\ntaken, or within the first term of return, if the student is on leave in the\nterm following the term when the course was taken. If approved, a W will be\nrecorded on the student\u2019s transcript in place of a grade for that course. W\u2019s\nwill not be included in the computation of the student\u2019s grade-point average.\nCourses will be expunged from the student\u2019s record only in exceptional\ncircumstances, at the discretion of the UASH Committee.\n\nPetitions from graduating seniors submitted later than the first UASH meeting\nfollowing graduation (which normally takes place shortly after graduation)\nwill not be accepted for consideration, except to correct an error by the\nInstitute.\n\n##  Grade-Point Average\n\nGrade-point average is computed by dividing the total number of credits earned\nin a term or an academic year by the total number of units taken in the\ncorresponding period. Units for which a grade of F has been received are\ncounted, even though the course may have subsequently been repeated. Grades of\nP or F obtained in courses graded on a pass/fail basis are not included in\ncomputing grade-point average.\n\nEach course at the Institute is assigned a number of units corresponding to\nthe total number of hours per week devoted to that subject, including\nclasswork, laboratory, and the normal outside preparation. Credits are awarded\nas shown in the table below.\n\n**No. of  \nUnits ** |  **A+** |  **A** |  **A\u2013** |  **B+** |  **B** |  **B\u2013** |  **C+** |  **C** |  **C\u2013** |  **D+** |  **D** |  **F**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n1  |  4  |  4  |  4  |  3  |  3  |  3  |  2  |  2  |  2  |  1  |  1  |  0   \n2  |  9  |  8  |  7  |  7  |  6  |  5  |  5  |  4  |  3  |  3  |  2  |  0   \n3  |  13  |  12  |  11  |  10  |  9  |  8  |  7  |  6  |  5  |  4  |  3  |  0   \n4  |  17  |  16  |  15  |  13  |  12  |  11  |  9  |  8  |  7  |  5  |  4  |  0   \n5  |  22  |  20  |  18  |  17  |  15  |  13  |  12  |  10  |  8  |  7  |  5  |  0   \n6  |  26  |  24  |  22  |  20  |  18  |  16  |  14  |  12  |  10  |  8  |  6  |  0   \n7  |  30  |  28  |  26  |  23  |  21  |  19  |  16  |  14  |  12  |  9  |  7  |  0   \n8  |  35  |  32  |  29  |  27  |  24  |  21  |  19  |  16  |  13  |  11  |  8  |  0   \n9  |  39  |  36  |  33  |  30  |  27  |  24  |  21  |  18  |  15  |  12  |  9  |  0   \n10  |  43  |  40  |  37  |  33  |  30  |  27  |  23  |  20  |  17  |  13  |  10  |  0   \n11  |  48  |  44  |  40  |  37  |  33  |  29  |  26  |  22  |  18  |  15  |  11  |  0   \n12  |  52  |  48  |  44  |  40  |  36  |  32  |  28  |  24  |  20  |  16  |  12  |  0   \n13  |  56  |  52  |  48  |  43  |  39  |  35  |  30  |  26  |  22  |  17  |  13  |  0   \n14  |  61  |  56  |  51  |  47  |  42  |  37  |  33  |  28  |  23  |  19  |  14  |  0   \n15  |  65  |  60  |  55  |  50  |  45  |  40  |  35  |  30  |  25  |  20  |  15  |  0   \n  \n  \n**Pass/Fail Grading, the following regulations apply**\n\n  * First-quarter and second-quarter First-Year students receive pass/fail grades in all Core and introductory courses listed by virtue of their classification as First-Year students by an admissions committee or, for students whose status after the first year is uncertain, by the Undergraduate Academic Standards and Honors Committee.\n  * All other students, undergraduate and graduate, in courses with numbers under 200 will receive letter grades unless the course is designated \u201cgraded pass/fail\u2019\u2019 or unless, when it is allowed, the student submits a change to the course\u2019s grading scheme on or before Drop Day.\n  * In courses with numbers 200 or greater that are not designated either \u201cgraded pass/fail\u2019\u2019 or \u201cletter grades only,\u2019\u2019 the instructor may decide separately for each student what class of grades to use.\n  * All research courses shall be designated \u201cgraded pass/fail.\u2019\u2019 All reading courses, seminar courses, or other courses that do not have a formal class structure shall be designated \u201cgraded pass/fail\u2019\u2019 unless the option secures an exemption from the Curriculum Committee or the Graduate Studies Committee and from the Faculty Board.\n  * A grade on the pass/fail system should be P if it would have been a D or better on the letter grade system. (Note that there is no D\u2013 grade.) The standards of failure in courses in which only pass/fail grades are used should be the same as they would be if the course were letter graded.\n  * Any instructor may, at their discretion, specify prior to registration that their course, if not classified by the above regulations, is to be graded on a \u201cletter grades only\u2019\u2019 basis or is to be graded pass/fail only, subject to possible review by the responsible option. The registrar must be notified of such specification two weeks before the beginning of registration. (Note: A course's grading scheme is not changed after it has begun.)\n  * Each term, any student may select, subject to requirements imposed by the student\u2019s option, two elective courses in which they are to be graded on a pass/fail basis if the course is not designated as \u201cletter grades only\u2019\u2019 and is not specifically required for the degree in their option. To make this election, a student must submit a change to the course\u2019s grading scheme in REGIS, or submit a written request to the Registrar\u2019s Office, on or before Drop Day. This election may be reversed or reinstated at any time before the deadline. Students must resubmit their schedule in REGIS after all changes, and the pass/fail election must be approved by the student\u2019s adviser. The instructor must allow any eligible student to make this election.\n  * Of the units offered to satisfy the requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree, no more than 90 may be in courses graded pass/fail because of the student\u2019s election (this does not include those courses taken in the first two terms during an undergraduate\u2019s first year (as a first-year student) or those designated pass/fail by the instructor, option, or curriculum committee).\n  * The Institute has approved changes to the Core Curriculum for the incoming class entering 2024. If you are interested, the details may be found in Appendix A.\n\n##  Procedures for Resolving Disputes over Grading\n\nAt Caltech, the instructor has full responsibility for assigning grades to\nstudents enrolled in a course. On occasion, a student may not understand how a\ngrade was determined and may seek further information. The student should\nfirst meet with the instructor or teaching assistant to discuss the grade. If\nafter doing so the student believes the grade is unjustified or capricious,\nthe following procedures are available.\n\nBefore the end of the term following the term when the grade was issued, the\nstudent should contact the academic mediator, appointed by the provost, who\nwill work with the student and instructor to resolve the problem. If the\nmediation effort is unsatisfactory to the student, they may request a formal\nreview by an appropriate executive officer or academic officer. The executive\nofficer will review the case and report the decision in writing to the\nstudent. If the executive officer decides that a change of grade is warranted,\nor if the student requests a further appeal, these shall be requested of the\ndivision chair. At the discretion of the division chair, a committee may be\nappointed to review the case. The committee members should interview everyone\ninvolved in the case (the student, the course instructor, the teaching\nassistant, and anyone else with relevant information), and make a written\nrecommendation to the division chair. Only the division chair can authorize\nthe registrar to enter a new grade in the student\u2019s transcript.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Academic Records of Veterans\n\nThe Institute maintains a written record of a student\u2019s previous education.\nThis is part of the student\u2019s official transcript, and included on this is a\nsummary of any prior college-level education. A true copy of a transcript of\ncollege-level work at other institutions is maintained as part of the\nstudent\u2019s record. The amount of credit granted for prior training is indicated\non the student\u2019s official transcript and, where this results in the shortening\nof a required training period in the case of a veteran, the Veterans\nAdministration is notified.\n\nThe Institute\u2019s official transcript for each student shows the progress that\nstudent is making at the Institute. There is a record of each course enrolled\nin each term with a grade recorded for the course. The total number of units\nearned is kept so that the record will show continued progress toward the\ndegree sought. The final grades are recorded at the end of each term of the\nschool year, and the accumulative permanent record has on it grades for all\nsubjects taken at the Institute. No student is allowed to enroll repeatedly in\na course and withdraw without penalty. If a student enrolls in a course, they\nare expected to complete the course or receive a failing grade unless they\nwithdraw from the course prior to the deadline for dropping courses. All\nstudents must maintain a minimum load equivalent to 12 quarter hours each\nterm; no student may drop courses that would bring them below this level of\neffort. At any time when the student falls below the required number of units,\nfails to receive satisfactory grades, or engages in unsatisfactory conduct,\nthe record is marked to indicate this, and the student is forbidden to\ncontinue at the Institute.\n\nThe grading system of the Institute is A+ (excellent) to F (failed). An A+ is\nequivalent to 4.3 and an F to 0.0. A student must maintain a grade-point\naverage of 1.9 in any term in order to be able to enroll in a successive term\nat the Institute. A minimum 1.9 overall grade-point average is required for\ngraduation. A student who drops below the required average (1.9 for a given\nterm) is dismissed and must petition for reinstatement. A student may be\nreinstated by the Undergraduate Academic Standards and Honors Committee and,\nif so, is required to earn a 1.9 GPA during the immediately following term.\nThe Veterans Administration is notified when a veteran is academically\ndismissed or is making unsatisfactory progress toward a degree. Since the\nInstitute requires all students to carry a minimum full load that corresponds\nto 12 quarter hours each term, any student who finishes a term in good\nstanding is considered to have made satisfactory progress. If a student\nwithdraws from a course before the final date for withdrawal, no grade is\ngiven in that course. The time spent in school counts, however, and the\nstudent may be considered to have not made satisfactory progress in the event\nof such withdrawal.\n\nIn order to withdraw from any course, a student must drop the course in REGIS\nor submit a written request to the Registrar\u2019s Office. The instructor should\nmaintain the date on which the student was last in official attendance in that\ncourse. If a student reenrolls in that course and successfully completes it,\nthat fact will be noted on their official transcript.\n\n###  Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018 (Section 103)\n\nCaltech adheres to the requirements of and complies with the Veterans Benefits\nand Transition Act of 2018, specifically S2248 PL 115-407 Section 103. This\nprovision was effective August 1, 2019 for any students who are considered \u201ca\ncovered individual\u201d using \u201cChapter 33: Post 9/11 GI Bill\u00ae\u201d benefits or any\nparticipants in \u201cChapter 31: Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program\u201d\nbenefits at a public, private for-profit, or not-for-profit institution\nregarding unpaid tuition and fees.\n\nCaltech permits any covered individual to attend or participate in courses\nduring the period beginning on the date on which the individual provides to\nthe educational institution a certificate of eligibility for entitlement to\neducational assistance under chapter 31 or 33 of this title.\n\nIn accordance with S2248 PL 115-407 Section 103 Caltech will not impose any\npenalty, including the assessment of late fees, the denial of access to\nclasses, libraries, or other Institute facilities, or the requirement that a\ncovered individual borrow additional funds, on any covered individual because\nof the individual\u2019s inability to meet their financial obligations to the\ninstitution due to the delayed disbursement of a payment to be provided by the\nSecretary under chapter 31 or 33 of this title.\n\nGI Bill\u00ae is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\n(VA). More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at\nthe official U.S. government Web site at\n[www.benefits.va.gov/gibill](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill).\n\n##  Access to Student Records\n\nThe Institute maintains educational records for each student that include\nname, address, student identification number (including Social Security\nnumber), information on parents, guardian, and spouse, general information on\nacademic status at the Institute, previous school data, results of\nstandardized admissions examinations, courses previously taken or being taken,\ncredits, grades, as well as other educational records. Applicants for\nfinancial aid have an additional file holding those records. The Family\nEducation Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and Caltech policy afford students\ncertain rights as well as establish limitations with respect to student\neducational records. These rights and limitations are as follows:\n\n1\\. Caltech permits disclosure of educational records, without consent of the\nstudent, to Institute officials with legitimate educational interests in them.\nAn Institute official is a person employed by the Institute in an\nadministrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support-staff position\n(including security personnel and health and diversity center staff), a person\nor company with whom the Institute has contracted (such as an attorney,\nauditor, consultants, contractors, or collection agent), a person serving on\nthe Board of Trustees, or a student serving on an official committee, such as\na disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another Institute official\nin performing their tasks. An Institute official has a legitimate educational\ninterest if they need to review an educational record in order to fulfill\ntheir professional responsibility. They are available to the registrar,\nprovost, president, general counsel, vice president for development and\ninstitute relations, vice president for student affairs, dean of graduate\nstudies, dean of undergraduate students, director of financial aid, and\nfaculty of the Institute and their respective staffs for the normal academic\nand business purposes of the Institute. Records involving financial aid are\nmaintained by the director of financial aid, and are available to the director\nand staff, to the dean of graduate studies and staff, to the Faculty Committee\non Scholarships and Financial Aid, and to the Faculty Committee on Graduate\nStudy, for the purpose of granting and administering the Institute\u2019s financial\naid program. Except as authorized by federal or state law or regulation, none\nof these education records nor any personally-identifiable information\ncontained therein, other than directory information (see below), may be made\navailable to anyone else, other than the student, without the consent of the\nstudent. Where the student consents to disclosure of personally-identifiable\ninformation from the student\u2019s education records and Caltech chooses to\ndisclose such information, if the student so requests, the Institute will\nprovide the student with a copy of the records disclosed. The Institute will\nmaintain a record of each request for access to and each disclosure of\npersonally-identifiable information from the education records of a student,\nas required by applicable federal law or regulation.\n\n2\\. Students are allowed access to their educational records as follows: A\nstudent may inspect and review their academic transcript during normal working\nhours. To inspect and review other records, the student must provide a written\nrequest to the registrar or to the director of financial aid or to the dean of\ngraduate studies or to the dean of undergraduate students, or their designees,\nas appropriate. A mutually-convenient time will be arranged within 45 days\nafter receipt of the request for the student to inspect and review the records\nin their file. At that time the student may examine all educational records in\nthe file with the exception of those specifically exempted by Part 99 of Title\n34 of the Code of Federal Regulations. If circumstances effectively prevent\nthe student from exercising their right to review their education records, the\nInstitute will make other arrangements. If a student believes the educational\nrecords relating to the student contain information that is inaccurate,\nmisleading, or in violation of the student\u2019s rights of privacy, the student\nmay ask the Institute to amend the record. The Institute will decide whether\nto amend the records as requested within a reasonable time after receiving the\nrequest. If the registrar, or the director of financial aid, or the dean of\ngraduate studies, or the dean of undergraduate students, or their designees,\ndecide not to amend the record as requested, the student will be informed of\nthe decision and of their right to a hearing. The student will have, on\nrequest, an opportunity for a hearing to challenge the content of the records\non the grounds that the information contained in the records is inaccurate,\nmisleading or in violation of the privacy rights of the student. To request a\nhearing, the student must submit a written request to the vice president for\nstudent affairs or their designee. The vice president for student affairs or\ntheir designee will schedule such a hearing within a reasonable time after\nreceipt of the request and will notify the student at a time reasonably in\nadvance of the hearing of its date, time, and place. The student will be\nafforded a full and fair opportunity to present evidence relevant to the\nissues raised and may be assisted or represented by individuals of their\nchoice at their own expense, including an attorney. The decision of the vice\npresident or designee will be in writing, will be rendered within a reasonable\ntime after the conclusion of the hearing, and will be final. This decision\nwill be based solely upon the evidence presented at the hearing and will\ninclude a summary of the evidence and of the reasons for the decision. If, as\na result of the hearing, the Institute decides that the information is\ninaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the privacy rights of the\nstudent, the Institute will amend the record accordingly, and inform the\nstudent of the amendment in writing. However, if, as a result of the hearing,\nthe Institute decides that the information is not inaccurate, misleading, or\notherwise in violation of the privacy rights of a student, it will inform the\nstudent of the right to place in the educational records a statement\ncommenting on the information in the records and/or setting forth any reasons\nfor disagreeing with the decision of the Institute. If the Institute places a\nstatement in the education records of the student, the Institute will maintain\nthe statement with the contested part of the record for as long as the record\nis maintained and will disclose the statement whenever it discloses the\nportion of the record to which the statement relates.\n\n3\\. The Institute considers the following to be directory information: a\nstudent\u2019s name, UID, addresses (permanent, campus and local/off-campus, and\nemail), associated telephone listings, ID photograph, date and place of birth,\nmajor field of study, year in school, current enrollment status, expected date\nof graduation, name of academic adviser, participation in officially\nrecognized activities and sports, weight and height if a member of an athletic\nteam, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, thesis title,\nhometown, and most recently attended educational agency or institution.\nDirectory information may be made available to requestors at the Institute\u2019s\ndiscretion. Any student may, however, have part or all of this information\nwithheld by notifying the registrar in writing. That information will then be\nwithheld for the balance of that academic year. If the information is to be\nwithheld in subsequent years, new requests must be filed.\n\n4\\. A student will not be required to waive any rights regarding access to\neducational records. However, a student may voluntarily waive in writing right\nof access to confidential statements made by third parties respecting\nadmission to educational agencies or institutions, applications for\nemployment, or the receipt of an honor or honorary recognition. In case of\nwaiver, the confidential statements will be used solely for the purposes for\nwhich they were specifically intended, and the student will, upon request, be\nnotified of the names of all persons making such confidential statements. If a\nstudent should desire to waive right of access, may contact the registrar for\nmore information.\n\n5\\. The Institute reserves the right to destroy from time to time any and all\neducational records that it maintains on a student, except to the extent that\nthe law requires their maintenance for a longer period of time. However, where\naccess to records has been requested, no destruction of those records will be\nallowed to take place until such access has been granted or denied.\n\n6\\. Students who believe their rights under FERPA may have been violated may\nfile a complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of\nEducation, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington D.C. 20202-4605.\n\n###  Transcripts of Records\n\nA student, or former student, may request that official transcripts of their\nrecords be forwarded to designated institutions or individuals. Requests\nshould be filed at the Registrar\u2019s Office at least five days before the date\non which the transcripts are to be mailed.\n\n##  PARENT, GUARDIAN, AND EMERGENCY CONTACT NOTIFICATION POLICY\n\nCaltech understands and supports a student\u2019s right to confidentiality\nregarding educational records1 as well as matters related to a student\u2019s\nexperience at the Institute. Most communications from Caltech regarding\nacademics, health and safety, advising, enrollment, and policies are directed\nonly to students. However, the Institute does encourage students to share\nimportant information with their parent(s) or guardian. Subject to the\nallowable exceptions under FERPA, there may be circumstances under which a\nCaltech administrator makes the determination that notification to parent(s)\nor a guardian is indicated, and notification may be made without a student\u2019s\nconsent. In most cases, when a Caltech administrator determines that involving\nparent(s) or guardian is necessary, the student will be given an opportunity\nto make contact in advance of the administrator\u2019s communication.\nAdministrators will consider any relevant information which may indicate that\nnotification to parent(s) or guardian may not be appropriate based on\nindividual circumstances. The Institute expects all students to designate an\nemergency contact who is a parent or guardian or other family member who may\nbe notified in order to address a health or safety emergency, and who is in a\nposition to make decisions on the student\u2019s behalf in the case of a medical\nemergency. An alternate emergency contact also may be identified for other\npurposes.\n\nSituations that may warrant the involvement of a student\u2019s, parent(s),\nguardian, or emergency contact may include, but are not limited to:\n\n####  1\\. Concerns about a student under the age of 18.\n\nCaltech administrators will initiate communication with the parent(s) or\nguardian of a minor student in the cases described below, as well as any other\nconcerns about a minor student that may benefit from collaboration with the\nstudent\u2019s support system.\n\n####  2\\. Change in enrollment or status of an undergraduate student.\n\nA change in the enrollment status of an undergraduate student may occur as a\nresult of disciplinary action, unsatisfactory academic progress, or other\nfactors. If an undergraduate student is separated from the Institute, the\nparent(s) or guardian will be notified by mail at the permanent address on\nfile.\n\n####  3\\. Medical emergencies.\n\nState law prohibits health care professionals from disclosing medical\ninformation to the parents or guardian of a student without the student\u2019s\nexplicit consent. In the event a student is incapacitated, unable to\ncommunicate, or otherwise cannot make decisions on their own behalf, the\nInstitute will first cooperate with medical providers and then notify the\nemergency contact, parent(s) or guardian on file as soon as possible.\n\n####  4\\. Unexplained absence from campus.\n\nCaltech has established a policy to assist in locating Caltech students living\nin Caltech campus housing when Caltech has determined a student to be missing.\nThe key components of this policy are as follows:\n\n  * _Designation of Confidential Contact._ Students have the option of identifying an individual to be contacted by Caltech within 24 hours after the time the student has been determined to be missing (missing person contact). This information will be accessible only to authorized campus officials and may not be disclosed except to law enforcement personnel in a missing person\u2019s investigation. If a student chooses not to provide a confidential contact and is deemed to be missing, Caltech will notify the student\u2019s emergency contact or parent.\n  * _Reporting and Investigation._ Any individual who believes a student living in on campus housing may be missing should immediately contact Caltech Campus Security. Once Caltech receives a missing student report, Security will notify the Vice President for Student Affairs, the Deans, the AVP for Student Affairs and Residential Experience and the Director of Housing. Upon notification that any student may be missing, Caltech will initiate an investigation. If a student is determined to have been missing for twenty-four (24) hours and has not returned to campus, Caltech will notify the appropriate law enforcement agency and initiate other notifications as provided below.\n  * _Notification Procedures._ A student\u2019s missing person contact will be notified within 24 hours of a determination by Caltech that the student is missing. If no missing person contact has been designated, the student\u2019s emergency contact will be notified. If the student is under 18 years of age and not an emancipated individual, Caltech is also required to notify a custodial parent or guardian within 24 hours of the determination that the student is missing.\n\n####  5\\. Significant disruption to the campus community.\n\nThe emergency contact, parent(s) or guardian of a student may be notified if\nthe student is behaving in a way that is substantially disruptive to the\ncampus community, there is reason to believe the student is at risk of harming\nthemselves or others, or is placed under arrest or charged with a crime\nrelated to conduct on campus.\n\n####  6\\. Repeated or flagrant violations of the Substance Abuse Policy.\n\nCaltech administrators may contact parent(s) or guardian if a student under\nthe age of 21 is found responsible for serious or repeated violations of\nInstitute policy related to the possession, use or distribution of alcohol or\ndrugs. Consideration in these situations will be given to the following\nconditions: the violation involved harm or threat of harm to self, others or\nproperty; the violation involved an arrest in which the student was taken into\ncustody; the violation resulted in or could result in the student being\nsuspended and/or removed from an Institute residence; the student has shown a\npattern of violations; the student required urgent medical intervention as a\nresult of consumption of alcohol and/or drugs.\n\n####  7\\. Student death.\n\nIn the event of a student death, Caltech administrators will cooperate with\nlaw enforcement, the coroner, medical personnel, and any other relevant\nofficials who will provide official notification to the deceased student\u2019s\nnext of kin.\n\nThere may be additional, unforeseen circumstances when we believe it is in the\nbest interest of the student to notify a parent or guardian. We reserve the\nright to act in such cases on our own best judgment, framed within the\napproach to emergency contact and parental/guardian notification stated above.\n\n_1_ _The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g;\n34 CFR Part 99)_\n\n##  Accreditations and Authorizations\n\nThe California Institute of Technology is accredited by the WASC Senior\nCollege and University Commission (WSCUC), 985 Atlantic Ave., Ste. 100,\nAlameda, CA 94501; (510) 748-9001. In addition, the Institute is authorized by\nthe California State Department of Education, Office of Private Postsecondary\nEducation, to operate as a private postsecondary educational institution and,\nby the same agency, to train veterans in the programs of the Veterans\nAdministration.\n\nThe Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, Inc. (111 Market Place,\nSuite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202-4012; 410-347-7700), has accredited Caltech\u2019s\nB.S. program in mechanical engineering. Further, the Committee on Professional\nTraining of the American Chemical Society has approved Caltech\u2019s B.S. program\nin chemistry.\n\nThe documents describing these accreditations and authorizations are on file\nand may be inspected in the Registrar\u2019s Office and the Provost\u2019s Office; the\noffice of the Division of Engineering and Applied Science also has the\ndocumentation for ABET.\n\n##  Student Problem Resolution Process\n\nCaltech provides a variety of routes, most of them informal, by which students\nmay bring complaints, which do not fall within the jurisdiction of other\nPolicies or the Honor System, for consideration and resolution. For example,\nin academic matters, students may begin with faculty-student conversations\nthat may extend to the deans, the option representatives, the division chairs,\nthe registrar, or to various committees having faculty and student members.\nNon-academic matters can be dealt with informally by student leaders, resident\nassociates, residential life coordinators, deans, and other student affairs\noffices. The Graduate Student Council (GSC) and the Associated Students of the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology (ASCIT) may become involved in some\ncomplaints, and sometimes ad hoc groups are formed to make recommendations.\n\nThe Problem-Resolution Process (Process) is intended to deal with complaints\nby currently enrolled students for which reasonable efforts by the available\ninformal routes have not led to an acceptable resolution.\n\nThe first step in this Process is for the student to consult with the\nappropriate deans. One of the deans will then determine if the issue falls\nunder this Process and, if appropriate, may appoint a facilitator to help\nresolve the issue. If the student\u2019s issue involves a decision or action of a\ndean, the vice president for student affairs or designee may appoint a\nfacilitator to help resolve the issue.\n\nA facilitator will assist the student in trying to work out the problem. If\nthe student is not satisfied with the results, the student may file a written\nnotice of appeal to the vice president for student affairs or their designee.\nThe decision of the vice president or designee is final.\n\nIf a student has a complaint about Caltech\u2019s compliance with academic program\nquality and accrediting standards that they believe warrants further attention\nafter exhausting the steps outlined above, they may contact the WASC Senior\nCollege and University Commission (WSCUC) at\n[www.wscuc.org/comments](http://www.wscuc.org/comments). WASC is the academic\naccrediting body for Caltech. An individual may contact the Bureau for Private\nPostsecondary Education (BPPE) for review of a complaint. BPPE may be\ncontacted at 2535 Capitol Oaks Drive, Suite 400, Sacramento, CA 95833,\nwebsite: [www.bppe.ca.gov](http://www.bppe.ca.gov); telephone: (916) 431-6959;\nfax: (916) 263-1897. Prospective students may contact WASC or the BPPE with\ncomplaints as well.\n\n##  Student Patent and Computer Software Agreement\n\nThe California Institute of Technology (Caltech) has a responsibility to see\nthat inventions and copyrightable materials (including software) developed in\nconnection with Caltech be used for the public benefit, and be consistent with\nCaltech\u2019s contractual obligations.

This is\nto ensure Caltech\u2019s compliance with its obligations, including the provisions\nof the Federal Bayh-Dole Act and implementing regulations. For work done at\nJPL, I agree to have all scientific and technical publications reviewed,\npursuant to JPL policy, prior to public release to ensure compliance with U.S.\nexport control laws.\n\nI understand that Caltech relies on this agreement when it enters into\ncontracts with others and obligates itself with respect to inventions and\ncomputer software developed at Caltech.\n\nRevised 03-23-2015\n\n##  Student Retention and Persistence Rates\n\nMost undergraduates enter Caltech at the first-year level. Of the 225 first-\nyear students enrolled during the 2020-21 academic year, 223 reenrolled in the\nfirst term of the 2021-22 academic year and are progressing, yielding a\npersistence rate* of 99 percent after all allowable exclusions. Of the 241\nfirst-year students enrolled during the 2014-15 academic year, 223 graduated\nby June 2021, yielding a graduation rate for this group of 93 percent after\nallowable exclusions.\n\nAt the graduate level, most students enter Caltech to pursue either the degree\nof Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy or, occasionally, both. Of the\n238 entering graduate students enrolled in a Ph.D. program during the 2020-21\nacademic year, 229 reenrolled in the first term of the 2020-21 academic year\nand are making satisfactory academic progress, resulting in a persistence\nrate* of 96 percent. Of the 7 entering graduate students enrolled in M.S.\nprograms during the 2020-21 academic year, 2 earned a terminal M.S. degree\nwithin one year and one completed the M.S. degree and continued in the Ph.D.\nprogram.\n\n##  Student Events\n\nCaltech is committed to providing its students, faculty and staff with an\nenvironment that promotes safe and responsible social interaction. Caltech\nrecognizes that student activities are an important part of campus life.\nStudents are required to follow Event Planning Procedures:\n[spa.caltech.edu](http://spa.caltech.edu).\n\n##  Student Vaccination Policy\n\nImmunization against life-threatening diseases is an important tool in the\nprevention and mitigation of infectious disease outbreaks. This vaccine policy\nmay be modified in response to changes in public health requirements or\nrecommendations. To protect the health of both students and the community as a\nwhole, Caltech has required the following vaccines (or serologic proof\nindicating immunity, when applicable) for all enrolled students:\n\n  * **Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR):** Two doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine **OR** blood test showing immunity (positive titers).\n  * **Varicella (Chicken Pox):** Two doses of varicella (chicken pox) vaccine **OR** blood test showing immunity (positive titer).\n  * **Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis (Tdap):** One dose of tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) given after age 7. Afterward, a booster dose of tetanus and diphtheria (Td) every ten years.\n  * **Meningococcal Conjugate ACWY (Meningitis):** One dose of meningococcal conjugate ACWY (meningitis) after age 16 for all students under age 22.\n\n**Recommended Vaccinations:**\n\n  * Annual Influenza (Flu) for all students\n  * COVID-19 vaccination for all students\n  * Hepatitis A for all students\n  * Hepatitis B for all students\n  * Human Papillomavirus (HPV) for all students\n  * Poliovirus (Polio) for all students\n  * Haemophilus influenza for certain students\n  * Jynneos (M-Pox) vaccine for certain students\n  * Meningitis B for certain students\n  * Pneumococcal for certain students\n  * Zooster vaccination for age 50 years or older\n\nSee wellness.caltech.edu policies for updates.\n\n##  PARENT, GUARDIAN, AND EMERGENCY CONTACT NOTIFICATION POLICY\n\nCaltech understands and supports a student\u2019s right to confidentiality\nregarding educational records1 as well as matters related to a student\u2019s\nexperience at the Institute. Most communications from Caltech regarding\nacademics, health and safety, advising, enrollment, and policies are directed\nonly to students. However, the Institute does encourage students to share\nimportant information with their parent(s) or guardian. Subject to the\nallowable exceptions under FERPA, there may be circumstances under which a\nCaltech administrator makes the determination that notification to parent(s)\nor a guardian is indicated, and notification may be made without a student\u2019s\nconsent.

Examples of inappropriate\nor unauthorized use of Caltech IT resources include:\n\n  * sending a communication or using electronic information resources, including websites, collaboration and communication platforms and social media sites to illegally discriminate against, harass, defame, or threaten individuals or organizations;\n  * sending communications that are threatening or that may constitute stalking under Caltech\u2019s policies regarding Violence Prevention or Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct policies;\n  * engaging in illegal conduct or conduct that violates Caltech policy;\n  * destruction of, damage to, or malicious tampering with equipment, software, or data belonging to Caltech or to others;\n  * disruption, interception, or unauthorized monitoring of electronic communications;\n  * interference with use of Caltech systems;\n  * bypassing or otherwise tampering with computer security systems;\n  * unauthorized use of accounts, passwords, or identification numbers;\n  * use that intentionally impedes the legitimate computing activities of others;\n  * use for commercial purposes;\n  * use for cryptocurrency mining or any other personal profit-generating activities;\n  * use for political or lobbying activity that jeopardizes Caltech\u2019s tax-exempt status and violates Caltech's Political Activities Guidelines;\n  * violation of third-party intellectual property rights, including rights protected under patent, trademark, and copyright laws;\n  * downloading, posting, or sharing copyrighted materials, or any other unauthorized use or distribution of copyrighted materials;\n  * violation of software license terms;\n  * unauthorized use of Caltech\u2019s trademarks;\n  * unauthorized disclosure of proprietary or confidential information;\n  * violations of privacy;\n  * academic dishonesty;\n  * sending social media chain mail, spam, or other junk messages;\n  * fraudulent activity using Caltech IT resources;\n  * downloading, viewing, and/or sharing of materials in violation of Caltech\u2019s policies regarding [Unlawful Harassment](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2641/caltech_institute_policy-unlawful_harassment.pdf) and [Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2925/caltech_institute_policy-sex_and_gender_based_misconduct.pdf);\n  * unauthorized intrusion into computer systems;\n  * unauthorized security testing or scanning of Caltech IT resources or of another entity;\n  * sending communications that attempt to hide the identity of the sender or represent the sender as someone else;\n  * altering or disabling security devices or security configurations on IT assets; or\n  * encrypting data or systems using cryptography that has not been reviewed and approved by Caltech.\n  * use of generative AI and large language model tolls in a manner that is inconsistent with Caltech's Guidance on the Use of Generative IA and Large Language Model Tools.\n\nCaltech will apply this policy consistent with applicable requirements under\nthe laws and regulations governing Caltech\u2019s operations. This policy will not\nbe construed or applied in a manner that improperly interferes with employees\u2019\nrights under the National Labor Relations Act.\n\nCaltech IT resources are Caltech property or licensed by Caltech for Caltech\u2019s\nuse. Users of Caltech IT resources should not have an expectation of privacy\nwith respect to their use of these resources or any of the data, files, or\nother records generated by, stored, or maintained on them.\n\nFor cybersecurity and other lawful purposes, Caltech may collect, store, and\nanalyze information on both of the following: (1) any and all use of Caltech\u2019s\nelectronic information resources and (2) any data or communications\ntransmitted to or from, received or printed from, or created, stored,\naccessed, or recorded on Caltech\u2019s electronic information resources. This is\ntrue regardless of the labeling of the data, the use of encryption, the\ndeletion of the data or communications, or any other factor.\n\nUsers of Caltech computing resources and information should understand the\nsensitivity level of the resources under their control and provide appropriate\nprotection to both systems and data. Password capabilities and other\nauthentication measures are provided to users in order to safeguard electronic\nmessages, data, files, and other records (including computer files and\nrecords, electronic mail, and voicemail) from unauthorized use. These\nsafeguards are not intended to provide confidentiality from Caltech monitoring\nwith respect to personal messages or files stored on electronic information\nresources owned or managed by Caltech.\n\nWhile Caltech does not routinely examine the content of electronic mail or\ncommunication messages or otherwise monitor individual usage, it does\nroutinely monitor the normal operation of computing and networking resources,\nincluding network activity patterns, system logs, general and individual usage\npatterns, and other indicia necessary to ensure the integrity and stability of\nits electronic information resources.\n\nCaltech will investigate suspected abuse, misuse, or compromise of its\nresources, systems, and services. Any user found to have violated this policy\nmay be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including loss of\nadministrative rights or network/system access, termination of employment,\nstudent expulsion, or being permanently excluded from Caltech-controlled\npremises.\n\nCaltech retains the right to inspect, review, or retain the content of\nelectronic messages or other data, files, or records generated, stored, or\nmaintained on Caltech IT resources at any time without prior notification. Any\nsuch action will be taken for reasons Caltech, within its discretion, deems to  \nbe legitimate. These legitimate reasons may include, but are not limited to,\nresponding to lawful subpoenas or court orders; investigating misconduct\n(including research misconduct); determining compliance with Caltech policies\nand the law; and locating electronic messages, data, files, or other records\nrelated to these purposes. Users must therefore understand that any electronic\nmessages, data, files, and other records generated by, stored, or maintained\non Caltech IT resources may be electronically accessed, reconstructed, or\nretrieved by Caltech even after they have been deleted.\n\nCaltech personnel who wish to access the content of electronic mail, data,\nfiles, or other records generated, stored, or maintained by any user must\nrequest authorization as follows: (1) from the provost for any situations that\nrequire access to electronic material associated with faculty and other\nacademic personnel; (2) from the associate vice president for human resources\nfor staff and postdoctoral scholars at campus or the JPL director for human\nresources for employees and postdoctoral scholars at JPL; (3) from the vice\npresident for student affairs for students; or (4) from the general counsel\nfor the purposes of complying with legal processes and requirements or to\npreserve user electronic information for possible subsequent access in\naccordance with this policy. In all cases, the Office of the General Counsel\nshould be consulted prior to deciding on whether to grant access. In the case\nof a time-critical matter, if the authorizing official is unavailable for a\ntimely response, the general counsel may authorize access. Users of Caltech IT\nresources are advised that some authorizations already have been granted. For\nexample, the Caltech information security team has certain authority to\nmonitor Caltech IT resources for cybersecurity purposes.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of Caltech electronic information resources is a\nprivilege, not a right, and Caltech may revoke this privilege or decline to\nextend this privilege at any time.\n\nSuspected illegal acts involving Caltech electronic information resources may\nbe reported to governmental authorities and may result in prosecution by those\nauthorities. Any questions concerning the appropriate use of any of Caltech\u2019s\nelectronic information resources or relevant Caltech policies should be\ndirected to the provost, the general counsel, the chief information officer,\nthe associate vice president for human resources, the JPL director for human\nresources, the dean of undergraduate students, or the dean of graduate\nstudies.\n\nReport any suspected security incident or violation via email ([[email\nprotected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-\nprotection#b6c5d3d5c3c4dfc2cff6d5d7dac2d3d5de98d3d2c3)) or, at JPL, by calling\nthe JPL Helpdesk (4-HELP) or via email ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-\nprotection#dfbebdaaacba9fb5afb3f1b1beacbef1b8b0a9)).\n\n##  Related Policies:\n\n  * [Nondiscrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy](http://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2647/caltech_institute_policy-nondiscrmination_and_equal_opportunity_employment.pdf)\n  * [Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy](http://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2925/caltech_institute_policy-sex_and_gender_based_misconduct.pdf)\n  * [Unlawful Harassment and Abusive Conduct Policy](http://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2641/caltech_institute_policy-unlawful_harassment.pdf)\n  * [IMSS Security Policies](https://www.imss.caltech.edu/services/information-security/security-policies)\n  * [Caltech Network Policy](http://www.imss.caltech.edu/services/information-security/security-policies/network-policy)\n  * [Confidentiality of Private Information Policy](http://www.imss.caltech.edu/services/information-security/security-policies/confidentiality-of-private-information)\n  * [Vulnerability Scan Policy](http://www.imss.caltech.edu/services/information-security/security-policies/vulnerability-scan-policy)\n  * [DMCA Infringement Policy](http://www.imss.caltech.edu/services/information-security/security-policies/dmca-infringement)\n  * [Safeguarding Export Controlled Data Policy](http://www.imss.caltech.edu/services/information-security/security-policies/safeguarding-export-controlled-data)\n  * [Email Policies](http://imss.sites.caltech.edu/services/email-calendar-messaging/email/email-policies)\n  * [Political Activities Guidelines](https://externalrelations.caltech.edu/documents/17630/Caltech_Political_Activities_Guidelines.pdf)\n  * [Guidance on the Use of Generative AI and Large Language Model Tools](https://www.caltech.edu/campus-life-events/campus-announcements/guidance-on-the-use-of-generative-ai-and-large-language-model-tools)  \n\n"

        "content": "The mission of the California Institute of Technology is to expand human\nknowledge and benefit society through research integrated with education. We\ninvestigate the most challenging, fundamental problems in science and\ntechnology in a singularly collegial, interdisciplinary atmosphere, while\neducating outstanding students to become creative members of society.\n\nExport control laws and regulations as referred to in this Policy include a\nnumber of federal laws and regulations that impact an export or import\ntransaction such as those of the Departments of State, Commerce, Treasury,\nDefense, Energy and U.S. Customs. These laws have existed for many years.\nEvents around the world, however, have pushed national security concerns to\nthe forefront. The U.S. government has responded to global security concerns\nby tightening the export control regulations that govern the transfer of U.S.\nstrategic technology for national security and foreign policy reasons and in\nfurtherance of US economic objectives. Moreover, Presidential National\nSecurity Directives mandate the establishment of research security programs to\nprotect against foreign government interference to address intellectual\nproperty theft, malign foreign talent programs, and to protect critical\ntechnologies that can be used by adversaries in ways that can jeopardize our\nnational security.\n\nThe export control laws are intended to control the transfer of sensitive\ninformation or goods to individuals, entities or countries of concern. The\nlaws impose restrictions dependent on the type of information or goods and the\nidentity of the foreign person or entity. The regulations contain a\nfundamental research exclusion and specific university exemptions that allow\nmost of the research activities being performed at U.S. universities to be\ncarried out without the need of export licenses or other restrictions, subject\nto certain conditions.\n\nThe National Policy on Transfer of Scientific, Technical and Engineering\nInformation, i.e., Presidential National Security Decision Directive 189 (NSDD\n189) recognizes the important contributions that U.S. universities make in\nscience and engineering that allow our nation to remain innovative and\ncompetitive. This National Policy provides the framework for the fundamental\nresearch exclusion. NSDD 189 defines fundamental research as:\n\n_Basic and applied research in science and engineering where the resulting\ninformation is to be shared broadly within the scientific community, as\ndistinguished from proprietary research and from industrial development,\ndesign, production, and product utilization, the results of which ordinarily\nare restricted for proprietary or national security reasons._\n\nThe fundamental research exclusion applies to basic and applied research in\nscience and engineering performed by universities, so long as that research is\ncarried out openly and without restrictions on publication or access to or\ndissemination of the research results.\n\nThe fundamental research exclusion applies only to research conducted in the\nUnited States. This exclusion allows most of the activities conducted at\nCaltech to be performed without the need for an export license. However, there\nare certain activities and information that are not covered by the fundamental\nresearch exclusion and remain subject to the export control laws and\nregulations.\n\nCaltech is an institution of higher learning conducting fundamental research\nin science and engineering. The exclusion allows most of the activities\nconducted in the United States to be performed without the need for an export\nlicense. While the fundamental research exclusion applies to much of the\nresearch carried out at Caltech, there are, nonetheless, certain activities\nand information that are not covered by the fundamental research exclusion and\nremain subject to the export control laws and regulations.\n\nExamples of activities not covered by the fundamental research exclusion are:\n\n  * Receipt of third-party export-controlled information which requires that appropriate measures be taken to ensure that the information is properly safeguarded;\n  * Under certain conditions, disclosure of specific information and the provision of specific types of services to foreign persons (e.g., individuals who are not U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents, or U.S. legal entities) inside the United States (\u201cdeemed exports\u201d);\n  * Engagement in specific activities with persons and entities while traveling abroad, even if the information relied upon is publicly available;\n  * The export of controlled items and information outside the United States including hardware, software, biological and chemical materials, and technical data; and\n  * Financial transactions or other dealings involving prohibited parties or sanctioned countries.\n\nThe export control laws and regulations apply to covered research activities\nregardless of whether they are unfunded or funded, e.g., by government\ncontract or grant.\n\nThe export control laws are administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce\nthrough its Export Administration Regulations (EAR \u2013 dual-use items), the U.S.\nDepartment of State through its International Traffic in Arms Regulations\n(ITAR \u2013 space and military items), and the U.S. Department of Treasury through\nits Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC \u2013 economic and trade sanctions).\nThese laws control the conditions under which certain information,\ntechnologies, and commodities can be transmitted overseas to anyone, including\nU.S. citizens, or to a foreign person on U.S. soil. Caltech is committed to\ncomplying fully with these federal laws and regulations.\n\nCaltech takes its commitment to openness in research very seriously. Caltech\u2019s\npolicy, as set forth in the Faculty Handbook, does not allow acceptance of any\nagreement, including a government contract or grant, that impinges on\nCaltech\u2019s ability to freely publish and otherwise disseminate the results of\nits research. The transfer of export-controlled information or items requires\nadded levels of security, safeguarding responsibilities and, in some\ninstances, government authorization. For these reasons, research activities in\nwhich students will be provided with export-controlled technology (including\ntechnical data, software or items) with ITAR or high EAR (e.g., 500- and\n600-series Export Control Classification Number*) controls or licensing\nrequirements, must be formally approved by the Office of the Provost.\n\n[* Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) are described on the\nDepartment of Commerce\u2019s website\nhere:](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/licensing/commerce-control-list-\nclassification/export-control-classification-number-eccncontrol-\nclassification-number-eccn) <https://www.bis.gov/ear>\n\nCaltech has an established Export Compliance Office and has an appointed\nExport Compliance Manager who also functions as Caltech\u2019s Empowered Official.\nThe Empowered Official is the person who has legal authority to sign export\ncontrol license applications and other requests for export approval on behalf\nof Caltech and is the person responsible for developing and implementing\nexport compliance programs, campus procedures, awareness and training programs\nfor faculty and staff.\n\nAll faculty and staff must comply fully with all applicable export control\nlaws and regulations. (The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a federally funded\nresearch and development center, has a separate Export Compliance Policy.)\nNoncompliance may result in violations that can subject both the individual\nand Caltech to civil sanctions and criminal penalties.\n\nIt is the responsibility of Caltech faculty and staff to ensure Caltech\u2019s\ncompliance with this policy and all related Caltech procedures.\n\nThe Export Compliance Manager has been designated as the primary contact for\nexport control issues.

        "content": "##  1.0 Policy\n\nThe mission of Caltech is to expand human knowledge and benefit society\nthrough research integrated with education. In pursuit of this mission,\nCaltech adheres to its [Code of Conduct](https://asic.caltech.edu/code-\nconduct) and strives for the highest level of integrity and public confidence.\nCaltech\u2019s integrity rests on the personal integrity of each of us who is\ncalled upon to act on behalf of Caltech. Caltech, including JPL, is committed\nto ensuring that decisions made on its behalf reflect the highest ethical\nstandards and that its research and instruction remain a rigorous and open\ninquiry, unencumbered by conflicts of interest, real or perceived, that might\naffect the sound judgment of its trustees, officers, senior management,\nfaculty, students, postdoctoral scholars, staff, JPL employees, and visitors.\nEach of us, therefore, is responsible for identifying and resolving conflicts\nbetween personal and institutional interests. We each must act in the best\ninterests of Caltech and refrain from taking part in any transaction where we\ndo not believe in good faith that we can act impartially.\n\nPersonal and Institutional conflicts of interest may affect Caltech\u2019s\ntrustees, officers, faculty, postdoctoral scholars, students, staff, JPL\nemployees, and visitors. A personal conflict of interest is a situation that\nmay compromise an individual\u2019s personal judgment and ability to remain\nobjective in carrying out Caltech business due to a relationship that directly\nor indirectly affects the interest of the individual or a family member.\n\nInstitutional conflicts of interest differ from personal conflicts of\ninterest. An institutional conflict of interest arises when the research,\nteaching, outreach, or other activities of Caltech may be compromised because\nof a financial, business or other interest held by Caltech that may affect, or\nappear to affect, research, teaching, outreach, or other Caltech activities in\nquestion.\n\nCaltech has established its conflict of interest policies and procedures that\napply to all Caltech employees, including faculty, to ensure compliance with\nCaltech\u2019s ethical standards as well as with the laws, rules, and regulations\nthat govern Institute activities, while fostering and sustaining an\nenvironment of openness and integrity.\n\n##  2.0 Personal Conflicts of Interest\n\nEach situation that presents an actual or potential for conflict of interest\nmust be fully disclosed to Caltech and avoided or adequately managed or\neliminated before moving forward. Conflicts of interest also include conflicts\nof commitment, which are situations in which outside activities, either paid\nor unpaid, interfere with an employee\u2019s primary obligation and commitment to\nCaltech. While everyone should take care to avoid conflicts of commitment,\nthere are special considerations, including required disclosures of outside\nactivities, affiliations and appointments, that may apply to those performing\nfederally-sponsored research at Caltech. Federal agency and private research\nsponsors have an interest in ensuring that researchers supported on their\nawards devote appropriate personal time and effort to funded research\nactivities and that their specific dedicated time and effort is not diverted\nto other activities The Division Chairs and the Office of Research Compliance\nat Campus and the Ethics Office at JPL serve as resources to researchers who\nhave questions concerning whether particular outside activities they are\nconsidering may pose a conflict of commitment; Faculty, postdocs, visiting\nresearchers, staff, and JPL employees are required to comply with this policy\nand must complete Caltech\u2019s Financial Interest and Commitment Disclosure Form\nwithin 30 days of hire and on an annual basis. Changes or additions to\nresponses on the form must be submitted within 30 days of acquiring a new\ninterest, or beginning an activity, or any change in interests or activities\npreviously disclosed.\n\nIn academic research, the term conflict of interest refers especially to\nsituations in which financial or other personal considerations may compromise,\nor may have the appearance of compromising, an investigator's professional\njudgment in conducting or reporting research. Biases can affect collection,\nanalysis, and interpretation of data, hiring of employees, procurement of\nmaterials, sharing of results, choice of protocol, and the use of statistical\nmethods. Conflicts of interest can affect all scholarly fields.\n\nThe broad principles in this policy encompass a variety of situations, many of\nwhich do not fall into patterns for which specific guidelines may be\nestablished. Conflicts of interest inevitably arise from time to time in\neveryday business life; some may appear to be inconsequential or may even be\nadvantageous to Caltech. It is important, however, that all employees make\ntimely and accurate disclosure of covered financial interests and outside\nactivities. Each employee should apply their sense of integrity and common\nsense to disclose any circumstances that are, may become, or may give the\nappearance of a possible conflict of interest. Supplementing this broad policy\nstatement are the following rules to be observed on specific matters:\n\n2.1 Each employee has a duty to act in the best interest of Caltech and avoid\nactions that would call into question the integrity of the employee or\nCaltech.\n\n2.2 An employee who has directly or through family or business connections, a\nmaterial interest in suppliers of goods or services, or an interest in\nentities doing business or seeking to do business with Caltech, should not act\non behalf of Caltech in any transaction involving that interest. No employee\nshould participate in the evaluation, selection, award, or administration of a\ncontract or other agreement with any entity with whom employment or potential\nemployment or other business arrangement is occurring or being considered.\n\n2.3 An employee should avoid outside activities involving obligations that may\nconflict or appear to conflict with Caltech interests, including its interest\nin the employee\u2019s full- or part-time services (i.e., a conflict of\ncommitment). Outside activities requiring disclosure include, but are not\nlimited to, paid or unpaid directorships, external academic appointments,\neditorial positions, service on advisory boards, consulting or similar\narrangements, and other outside employment. Campus staff and JPL employees and\npostdoctoral scholars are required to obtain approval prior to engaging in\noutside activities. Campus staff and postdoctoral scholars must complete the\n[Request for Outside\nActivity](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2750/outside_activity_request_form_2019_fillable.pdf)\nform as required in [Personnel Memorandum PM\n9-3](https://www.hr.caltech.edu/documents/2921/pm_9-3.pdf). JPL Employees and\nJPL postdoctoral scholars should submit outside activity requests\nelectronically and may contact the JPL Ethics Office for assistance.\n\n2.4 To avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, an employee should\nprovide full disclosure of any business or financial enterprise or activity in\nwhich they are involved that might influence, or appear to influence, their\nofficial decisions or actions on Caltech matters. .\n\n2.5 An employee should refrain from personal activities that include, but are\nnot limited to, the purchase or sale of securities, real property, or other\ngoods or services in which they could use or might appear to have the\nopportunity to use, for personal gain, confidential information or special\nknowledge gained as a result of their relationship with Caltech.\n\n2.6 Employees should refrain from the unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic\ninformation they have access to as a result of their position at Caltech and\nmust not use nonpublic information accessed through the performance of a\nsponsored contract or other agreement for personal gain.\n\n2.7 No employee should make unauthorized use of Caltech resources for their\npersonal benefit or for the benefit of any other person. Incidental personal\nuse of resources is authorized by Caltech. See [Acceptable Use of Electronic\nInformation and Computing Resources\nPolicy](https://www.hr.caltech.edu/resources/institute-policies/acceptable-\nuse-electronic-resources-policy), and JPL Rules for requirements on incidental\nuse and activities at JPL.\n\n2.8 It is sound practice to discourage gifts and favors from persons or\norganizations with whom Caltech has a business relationship or with whom a\nbusiness relationship is being considered. Personal gifts and gratuities with\nmore than nominal value should be tactfully declined or returned to the\nofferor to avoid any appearance or suggestion of improper influence. Any\nemployee involved in awarding or administering contracts or other agreements\nfunded with Federal or other government funds should keep in mind that\napplicable laws contain prohibitions against soliciting or accepting\ngratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or\npotential contractors. See the JPL Gifts and Gratuities policy for additional\nguidance on gifts  \nat JPL.\n\n2.9 Any employee doing business on behalf of Caltech with specific vendors\nshould refrain from going on leisure trips with representatives of those\nvendors. Such trips are not appropriate, even when a staff employee pays a fee\nto the vendor to participate in such trips.\n\n2.10 No employee should act in any Institute matter involving a member of\ntheir family or an individual with whom they have a similar relationship\n(family member), including, but not limited to, matters affecting a family\nmembers\u2019 employment or evaluation or advancement at Caltech. Family members\ninclude an employee\u2019s parents, grandparents, spouse, domestic partner,\nchildren, brothers, sisters, in-laws, an individual with whom the employee has\na significant personal relationship, and an individual who is a member of the\nemployee\u2019s household, or who cohabitates with the employee. The employment of\nRelatives as that term is defined in [Personnel Memorandum (PM\n9),](https://www.hr.caltech.edu/documents/2685/pm_09.pdf) is subject to the\nconditions and restrictions described in [PM\n9](https://www.hr.caltech.edu/documents/2685/pm_09.pdf), including the\nrequirement to complete the Nepotism Evaluation process whenever a relative of\nan employee is considered for employment in the same organization as the\nemployee.\n\nIn addition to making required disclosures, any employee who believes that\nthey have other financial interests or activities that may conflict with these\nrules or otherwise create a conflict of interest, should make an appropriate\ndisclosure. You may also report concerns about possible conflicts of interest\non the part of others by calling the Campus Hotline at (626) 395-8787 or\nsubmitting a [hotline form](https://asic.caltech.edu/caltech-hotline/contact).\nJPL employees should may also report concerns using the JPL Ethics Help line\nat (866) 405-7536. Further direction for JPL employees is available by\nreviewing Laboratory policies and requirements and seeking guidance and/or\nreporting conflict of interest concerns by contacting the JPL Ethics Office at\n(818) 354-6338 or email at [[email protected]](http://Ethics-\nOffice@jpl.nasa.gov).\n\n##  3.0 Additional Faculty Responsibilities\n\nIt is acknowledged that, in their wider roles as academicians and\nprofessionals, the faculty may be subject to conflicts of interest and\ncommitment that are not within the scope of a policy that is designed to\naddress conflicts of interest in the employer-employee setting. For example,\nthis policy is not designed to address conflicts that may be encountered in\nservice to a professional society or peer review of journal submissions or of\nresearch grant applications. Other activities not covered by this policy are\nbest handled within the ethical guidelines established by the Faculty\nHandbook. Faculty members must be aware of potential conflicts to ensure an\nopen and productive environment for research and teaching. Conflicts of\ninterest may arise when faculty members have the opportunity to influence\nCaltech's business decisions or when outside relationships may or may appear\nto compromise the integrity of decisions made as teachers and researchers. A\nfaculty member's general commitment to Caltech requires that members perform\ntheir responsibilities to Caltech and appropriately use their own judgment in\ndeciding whether to engage in a variety of extramural activities, within the\nconfines set forth in the Faculty Handbook and any obligations prescribed by\nresearch sponsors. As a result, Caltech relies on its faculty to be alert to\nthe possible effects of outside activities and financial interests on the\nintegrity of their decisions and on their ability to fulfill their obligations\nto Caltech and to federal and private research sponsors. Accordingly, in\naddition to the conflict rules set forth above, the following guidance is\nprovided for faculty:\n\n3.1 Disclosure is imperative if the faculty member directs students in a\nresearch area and, as a result, the faculty member intends to realize\nfinancial gain. An example is a research area within the ambit of a business\nin which the faculty member has a significant ownership interest or is\nemployed by or acts as a consultant for the business. Any involvement of\nundergraduates, graduate students, or postdoctoral scholars in the outside\nprofessional activities of the faculty member directing the student's or\npostdoc\u2019s research must be reviewed by the Office of Research Compliance and\nspecifically approved, in advance, by the division chair and vice provost. The\nstudent or postdoctoral scholar must also sign the written disclosure to\nsignify understanding of the issues involved.\n\n3.2 Disclosure is mandatory if the faculty member has a Significant Financial\nInterest in or a commitment to a for profit, not-for-profit, or governmental\nentity (Entity) that is related to or overlaps with the faculty member's\ninstitutional responsibilities.\n\n3.3 Disclosure is mandatory if the faculty member is to receive sponsored\nsupport for research from a business for which the faculty member is a\nconsultant, or in which the faculty member has a significant financial\ninterest.\n\n##  4.0 Conflict of Interest Requirements Imposed by Federal Sponsors\n\nCertain Federal sponsors have issued specific rules regarding the disclosure\nof significant financial interests, the management of financial conflicts of\ninterest and conflicts of commitment, the disclosure of all resources made\navailable to a researcher in support of their research, and all academic and\nindustry roles and appointments. Such disclosures, and consideration by\nCaltech of their implications for research integrity, are a condition for\nsubmitting proposals and accepting awards of financial support from these\nagencies. Members of the Caltech community proposing or working on any\nactivity funded by a federal sponsor are required to comply with [Caltech\u2019s\nPolicy and Procedures for Managing Conflict of Interest Requirements Imposed\nby Federal Sponsors, and other sponsor disclosure\nrequirements.](https://researchcompliance.caltech.edu/documents/7348/fedawardcoi_pdf.pdf)\nThe Office of Research Compliance at Campus and the Ethics Office at JPL\nshould be consulted whenever researchers have questions concerning whether and\nhow certain information should be disclosed in connection with the submission\nof proposals for federal funding and during the lifecycle of an award.\n\n##  5.0 Institutional Conflicts of Interest Policy\n\nCaltech has many legitimate interests that may at times conflict. Management\nof institutional conflicts of interest is by its very nature more complex than\nthat of personal conflicts of interest. External relationships with sponsors\nand supporters of the institution, the local community\u2019s acceptance of\neconomic development activities, the institution\u2019s obligations as a charitable\norganization receiving preferential tax treatment, and the institution\u2019s\nperception of its teaching, research, and academic missions all impact how\npotential conflicts of interest are managed. The examples and issues presented\nbelow do not necessarily constitute unacceptable conflicts of interest. Each\ncase must be judged on the facts and merits of the relationship with an eye to\nwhat reasonable individuals outside Caltech might consider to be an\nunacceptable conflict of interest. Any activity, financial or operational,\nthat may bring into question Caltech\u2019s reputation, integrity, or objectivity\nshould be considered for possible conflicts of interest. The following are\nexamples of potential situations that may give rise to institutional conflicts\nof interest:\n\n5.1 Significant gifts to Caltech from a commercial sponsor of research may\nraise questions about the influence of the company on Caltech\u2019s research\nprograms and how they are managed. Similar concerns arise when individual\ncompanies sponsor research or provide significant consulting income to a\nsignificant number of faculty members within a single academic division.\nParticular attention should be given to identifying and managing potential\nconflicts arising when a company sponsors research involving human\nparticipants and Caltech has a financial or business interest in the company.\n\n5.2 Gifts or the promise of gifts, in exchange for favorable terms on a\ntechnology license or a first look at intellectual property may also pose a\nproblem.\n\n5.3 The acquisition of goods and services for Caltech represents a large\nportion of Caltech\u2019s expenditures. Purchasing goods and services from\ncompanies that sponsor research at Caltech, or who are licensees of Institute\ntechnology, may raise issues similar to those raised by large gifts from\ncommercial sponsors.\n\n5.4 A potential institutional conflict of interest exists simply by Caltech\nhaving a license agreement with, or an equity position in, a company\nsponsoring a faculty member\u2019s research. In these situations, there may be, or\nmay appear to be, a bias to accept terms and conditions that would facilitate\nthe company\u2019s success.\n\nIf you identify a situation that may pose an institutional conflict of\ninterest, you should report the situation to either the vice president for\nadministration and chief financial officer or to the provost on campus or to\nthe associate director for business at JPL. You may also make a report by\ncalling the Campus Hotline at [(626) 395-8787](tel:\\(626\\) 395-8787) or\nsubmitting a [hotline form](https://asic.caltech.edu/caltech-hotline/contact),\ncalling the JPL Ethics Office at [(818) 354-6338](tel:\\(818\\) 354-6338).\n\n"

        "content": "##  SECTION I: INTRODUCTION\n\n##  1.0 Policy\n\nIt is the policy of Caltech to provide a work and academic environment free of\nsex discrimination, including sexual misconduct, and retaliation. Caltech does\nnot discriminate on the basis of sex and prohibits sex discrimination in any\neducation program or activity that it operates, as required by Title IX and\nother Federal and State law, including in admissions and employment. Caltech\nwill not tolerate such conduct and is committed to educating the community in\nways to prevent its occurrence.\n\nSex discrimination, sex-based harassment, sexual misconduct, including sexual\nassault, sexual battery, dating and domestic violence, sexual exploitation,\nand stalking (collectively \u201csex discrimination\u201d) constitute prohibited conduct\nand violate this policy. Discrimination on the basis of sex includes\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy\nor related conditions (including childbirth, termination of pregnancy, or\nlactation, and related medical conditions or recovery from such conditions),\nsexual orientation, gender expression, and gender identity. Such conduct\nviolates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; Title IX of\nthe Education Code; and California law.\n\nCaltech will promptly, equitably, and effectively address any prohibited\nconduct which it has notice of using the resolution processes described in the\nSex Discrimination Procedures (\u201cprocedures\u201d). Caltech provides all parties\nwith appropriate due process. Individuals who violate this policy may be\nsubject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment,\nstudent expulsion, or being permanently excluded from Caltech-controlled\npremises.\n\nAny reference in this policy to a Caltech administrator is understood to\ninclude not only that administrator but also their designee.\n\n##  2.0 Scope\n\nThis policy applies to all students, faculty, supervisory and nonsupervisory\nstaff, JPL employees, postdoctoral scholars, volunteers, interns, vendors,\nindependent contractors, persons performing services under contract with the\nInstitute, visitors, and any other individuals who are regularly or\ntemporarily employed, studying, living, visiting, or otherwise participating\nin or attempting to participate in Caltech\u2019s educational programs or\nactivities at the time of the alleged sex discrimination (\u201ccovered persons\u201d).\n\nOrganizations affiliated with the Institute or that use Caltech property or\nresources in connection with their activities, including student\norganizations, also are prohibited from engaging in prohibited conduct.\n\nThis policy applies to all sex discrimination occurring in Caltech\u2019s education\nprograms or activities in the United States, including at the Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory (JPL). For purposes of this section, conduct that occurs under\nCaltech\u2019s education program or activity includes but is not limited to conduct\nthat occurs in locations, at events, or in circumstances in which the Caltech\nexercises substantial control over both the respondent and the context in\nwhich the conduct occurred, in a building owned or controlled by a student\norganization (e.g., in space provided to a student club) that is officially\nrecognized by Caltech, and conduct that is otherwise subject to Caltech\u2019s\ndisciplinary authority. Caltech has an obligation to address a sex-based\nhostile environment under its education program or activity, even when some\nconduct alleged to be contributing to the hostile environment occurred outside\nCaltech\u2019s education program or activity or outside the United States.\n\nEven if Caltech does not have jurisdiction under this policy over the person\naccused of prohibited conduct, or the allegations reported, Caltech will take\nprompt action, as warranted and appropriate, to provide for the safety and\nwell-being of the individual reporting and the campus community, including\ntaking reasonable steps to stop and remedy the effects of the prohibited\nconduct and to prevent recurrence of the behavior.\n\n##  3.0 Preservation of Evidence of Prohibited Conduct\n\nProhibited conduct, as defined in this policy, may also be a crime.\nIndividuals who have experienced sexual violence are urged to seek medical\ntreatment as soon as possible. Sexual assault forensic exams (or rape kit\ntests) are available free of charge at multiple local medical centers and\nfacilitate both evidence preservation and any necessary medical treatment.\nEvidence preservation is important in case an individual would like to file a\nreport with law enforcement, pursue civil litigation, or obtain a protective\norder. If an individual chooses to receive a forensic exam, they should avoid\nshowering, bathing, douching, eating, drinking, washing their hands, or\nbrushing their teeth until after the medical examination. It is recommended\nthat exams be performed within 72 hours of the incident, however exams still\nmay be possible after 72 hours. Individuals should save all clothing worn at\nthe time of the assault. Each item of clothing should be placed in a separate\npaper bag, not a plastic bag. Individuals who have experienced sexual violence\nare strongly encouraged to preserve all physical and electronic evidence.\n\nExamples of physical evidence may include clothing, bedding, contraceptives,\nletters, and notes. Electronic evidence relating to any type of incident of\nprohibited conduct may include texts, emails, photos, social media posts, and\nmessages to third parties. Any such items relating to an incident of\nprohibited conduct should be preserved. Once an individual reports a concern\nor receives notification of their involvement in a report or complaint under\nthis policy, whether as a respondent or witness, they are required to preserve\nany physical or electronic evidence they have. An intentional failure to\npreserve such evidence may be grounds for disciplinary action.\n\n##  4.0 Emergency Notifications and Timely Warnings\n\nIn the event of a situation on campus that involves an immediate threat to the\nhealth or safety of students or employees, Caltech will issue an emergency\nnotification consistent with its emergency notification procedures. In the\nevent that Caltech believes that there is a serious or continuing threat to\nthe campus community that meets Clery requirements, Caltech will issue a\ntimely warning consistent with its timely warning procedures. Emergency\nnotifications and timely warnings do not disclose the name of the victim.\n\n##  SECTION II: REPORTING CONCERNS AND COMPLAINTS\n\n##  5.0 Reporting to Caltech\n\nAnyone who witnesses, experiences, or is otherwise aware of conduct that the\nindividual believes to be in violation of this policy, including retaliation,\nis urged to contact Caltech immediately. Individuals are encouraged to report\nto the Title IX Coordinator or a deputy coordinator. Employees, supervisory\nemployees, and Responsible Employees must meet additional requirements related\nto reporting as described below.\n\nAn individual who has experienced sexual misconduct is encouraged to\nimmediately seek assistance from a medical provider as appropriate and report\nthe incident to Caltech and to local law enforcement. The confidential Campus\nSexual Violence Advocate is available to provide support and assistance.\nReports to Caltech and law enforcement may be pursued simultaneously.\n\nAny employee in a supervisory role, including faculty, and any other employee\nwho is a Responsible Employee as defined in Section 5.2, must promptly report\nall alleged sex discrimination, including sex-based harassment, sexual\nmisconduct, and retaliation, regardless of its alleged severity or frequency,\nto the Title IX Coordinator at campus or the JPL Deputy Title IX Coordinator\nat JPL, who will provide guidance and advice. In addition, all other\nemployees,\n\nwith the exception of Confidential Employees as defined in Section 5.2, are\nrequired to either: (a) notify the Title IX Coordinator when the employee has\ninformation about conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination\nunder this policy; or (b) provide the contact information of the Title IX\nCoordinator and information about how to make a complaint of sex\ndiscrimination to any person who provides the employee with information about\nconduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination under this policy.\n\nProhibited conduct should be reported whether or not the person reporting is\nthe person alleged to be the victim of the alleged prohibited conduct. Reports\nmay be made in person, by mail, by telephone, by electronic mail, or by other\nmeans to the Title IX Coordinator or a deputy coordinator. A [Report a Concern\nForm](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=2elb_XJ7-U2DDrH5zFtEvUobj3A0Xb1PpGAk36xut5VUNThMTkdSWU1JVVlMRkhPU09USlA2QlBQNCQlQCN0PWcu&wdLOR=c39BF9F91-5ECA-A44A-B168-0AA78DD183C4)\nis available on the Equity and Title IX Office website, which can be submitted\nanonymously by not filling in the contact information. The Report Form is also\navailable from the Equity and Title IX Office and at\n[equity.caltech.edu](https://equity.caltech.edu/). A member of the Caltech\ncommunity who is required to or wishes to report prohibited conduct should do\nso as soon as possible after the incident, although reports may be made at any\ntime.\n\nIf a member of the Caltech community would like support and guidance in\nreporting prohibited conduct, they may contact the Title IX Coordinator or a\ndeputy coordinator, one of the deans or associate deans, the director of\nemployee and organizational development in Human Resources, or the JPL section\nmanager of talent management or Human Resources Business Partners at JPL. They\nmay also contact any of the EEO coordinators identified in the\n[Nondiscrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity\nPolicy](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2647/caltech_institute_policy-\nnondiscrmination_and_equal_opportunity_employment.pdf).\n\nCaltech is committed to protecting the privacy of all individuals involved in\na report of prohibited conduct to the extent possible. All employees making,\nand administrators involved in responding to a report of prohibited conduct\nare expected to properly safeguard and maintain the privacy of sensitive\npersonal information. Caltech will make every effort to protect individuals\u2019\nprivacy interests consistent with Caltech\u2019s obligation to address reports made\nto Caltech.\n\n###  5.1 Title IX Coordinator\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator is responsible for coordinating Caltech\u2019s compliance\nwith Title IX and for Caltech\u2019s overall response to prohibited conduct falling\nunder applicable law, including Title IX.

Caltech\u2019s primary concern is the\nsafety of the campus community. Therefore, a student who participates as a\ncomplainant or witness in an investigation of sexual assault, dating violence,\ndomestic violence, or stalking will not be subject to disciplinary sanctions\nfor a violation of Caltech\u2019s student conduct policies at or near the time of\nthe incident, including but not limited to the Substance Abuse policy, unless\nCaltech determines that the violation was egregious. Egregious violations\ninclude but not limited to an action that places the health or safety of any\nother person at risk or involves conduct that violates Caltech\u2019s policies\nprohibiting discrimination or other serious misconduct like plagiarism,\ncheating, research misconduct, or other forms of academic dishonesty. The\napplication and scope of amnesty from disciplinary sanctions for alleged\nvictims and witnesses who are employees is within the discretion of the Title\nIX Coordinator and Director for Employee and Organizational Development.\n\n###  5.5 Notification of Law Enforcement as Required by California Law\n\nIndividuals who have experienced sexual assault, stalking, sexual\nexploitation, or domestic relationship or dating violence are encouraged to\nnotify local law enforcement.\n\nCaltech will assist in notifying law enforcement if the individual so chooses.\nIf a complaint includes allegations that may constitute a possible crime, the\nTitle IX Coordinator will notify the complainant of their right to determine\nwhether to notify law enforcement. An individual who has experienced sexual\nviolence also has the right to decline to notify law enforcement or Caltech.\nContact information for the Pasadena Police Department (PPD) is provided\nbelow.\n\nPasadena Police Department  \nCall 911 for Emergency Response  \nNon-Emergency Response: (626) 744-4241  \n207 N. Garfield Ave., Pasadena, CA 91101\n\nCaltech makes the following mandated reports of sexual misconduct to law\nenforcement: (a) incidents of sexual assault or sexual battery of a minor,\nincluding the identities of the parties, as required under California law; and\n(b) summary reports of incidents of sexual assault or sexual battery, under\nCalifornia Education Code Section 67383; however, Caltech will not report\nidentifying information about the complainant in the summary report without\nthe complainant\u2019s consent after being notified of their right to have\npersonally identifying information withheld. If the complainant does not\nconsent to be identified, personally identifying information about the\nrespondent also will not be provided.\n\nIndividuals may also engage with the confidential Campus Sexual Violence\nAdvocate who can facilitate a report to law enforcement.\n\n##  6.0 Reports Involving Minors\n\nEvery member of the Caltech community who knows of or reasonably suspects\nchild abuse or neglect occurring in any Caltech\u2019s education programs or\nactivity, including any prohibited conduct involving a minor, has a personal\nresponsibility to report the suspected child abuse or neglect to [Caltech\nSecurity](https://security.caltech.edu/) or the [JPL Protective Services\nDivision](https://psd.jpl.nasa.gov/site/) immediately.\n\nCaltech employees who are mandated reporters have additional, legally required\nreporting obligations, including reporting immediately to the LA County Office\nof Child Protection and/or the local police department. See [Mandated Reporter\nGuidelines](https://protectionofminors.caltech.edu/mandated-reporters) and the\n[Violence Prevention\nPolicy](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2924/caltech_institute_policy-\nviolence_prevention.pdf) for more information.\n\n##  7.0 False Reports/Statements\n\nCaltech expects its members to act with honesty, sincerity, and good faith in\nreporting concerns under this policy. Caltech will not tolerate intentional\nfalse reporting of information, allegations, or evidence. A good faith\ncomplaint that is not substantiated by a preponderance of the evidence after\nan investigation is not considered a false report.\n\nHowever, when a complainant or third party is found to have intentionally\nfabricated or knowingly misrepresented information, allegations, or evidence,\nor otherwise to have acted with an intent to deceive or mislead in any of\ntheir dealings relating to Caltech\u2019s administration of this policy, they may\nbe subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of\nemployment, student expulsion, or being permanently excluded from Caltech-\ncontrolled premises.\n\n##  8.0 Privacy\n\nCaltech will maintain the privacy of all individuals involved in a report of\nprohibited conduct to the extent practicable and consistent with legal\nrequirements. Caltech will not share personally identifiable information\nexcept as permitted by, or to fulfill the purposes of applicable laws and\nregulations (e.g., Title IX, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act\n(FERPA)) and their implementing regulations, or as required by law, including\nany investigation, or resolution proceeding arising under this policy and\nrelated procedures. These steps will not restrict the ability of the parties\nto obtain and present evidence, including by speaking to witnesses; consulting\nwith their family members, confidential resources, or advisors; or otherwise\npreparing for or participating in resolution processes under the procedures.\n\n###  8.1 Unauthorized Disclosure of Information\n\nParties and Advisors are prohibited from the unauthorized disclosure of\ninformation obtained from Caltech through any resolution process to the extent\nthat information is the work product of Caltech (meaning it has been produced,\ncompiled, or written by Caltech for purposes of its investigation or other\nresolution of a complaint). It is also a violation of Caltech\u2019s policy to\npublicly disclose Caltech work product or a party\u2019s personally identifiable\ninformation without authorization or consent. Violation of this policy is\nsubject to significant sanctions.\n\n###  8.2 Unauthorized Recordings\n\nMeetings or conversations that take place under this policy and the\nprocedures, may not be audio- or visually recorded by anyone other than by\nmembers of the Equity and Title IX Office, in compliance with Title IX who\nwill record certain proceedings conducted under the procedures in order to\nprovide a verbatim record of the proceeding. These recordings will be\nmaintained by the Equity and Title IX Office.\n\n##  9.0 Requests for Confidentiality or that Complaint Not Be Pursued\n\nWith respect to allegations of prohibited conduct under this policy, the Title\nIX Coordinator and deputy coordinators make every effort to respect the\nconcerns and goals of complainants, as well as their capacity to make\nindependent choices regarding resolution options for addressing their\ncomplaints under this policy and the procedures.\n\nIn instances where a complainant requests that their name not be used, that\nCaltech not pursue any action against the respondent, including an\ninvestigation, or that no disciplinary action be taken, the Title IX\nCoordinator will seriously consider the request, including the complainant\u2019s\nreasonable safety concerns regarding initiation of a complaint. The Title IX\nCoordinator will discuss with the complainant the reasons for their requests\nand attempt to address the underlying concerns, such as taking steps to\nprevent retaliation, but weigh the request against Caltech\u2019s responsibilities,\nincluding under applicable laws, to take action to provide a safe,\nnonthreatening, and nondiscriminatory environment for all community members,\nincluding the complainant. The Title IX Coordinator will discuss with the\ncomplainant the reasons for their requests and attempt to address the\nunderlying concerns, such as taking steps to prevent retaliation.\n\nWhere the complainant remains committed to the requests mentioned above, and\nthe prohibited conduct falls under Section 12.0 below, the Title IX\nCoordinator will weigh the request against factors that may lead the Title IX\nCoordinator to take action on behalf of Caltech, which may be contrary to the\nwishes of the complainant, including potentially disclosing the complainant\u2019s\nname and/or proceeding to an investigation, to protect the health and safety\nof the complainant and the Caltech community. The factors considered are\nwithin the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator and include, but are not\nlimited to, the nature and seriousness of the alleged conduct, whether the\nallegations are contested, the involvement of multiple respondents, the\nexistence of multiple or prior reports of misconduct against the respondent,\nwhether there was a weapon, physical restraints, battery, or other violence\ninvolved, whether the use of alcohol or drugs to induce vulnerability to\nsexual activity without consent was allegedly involved, whether there is\nevidence of a pattern of conduct, the presence of other circumstances that\nsuggest there is a significant risk that the respondent will commit further\nacts of prohibited conduct, the age of the parties, whether the respondent is\nan employee, including whether it is a faculty member or staff member who has\noversight of students, whether there is a power imbalance between the\ncomplainant and respondent, whether the complainant believes that the\ncomplainant will be less safe if the complainant\u2019s name is disclosed or an\ninvestigation is conducted, and whether Caltech is able to conduct a thorough\ninvestigation and obtain relevant evidence in the absence of the complainant\u2019s\ncooperation. If after considering the relevant factors, the Title IX\nCoordinator determines that the alleged conduct presents an imminent and\nserious threat to the complainant or other person, or that the alleged conduct\nprevents Caltech from ensuring equal access to its education programs and\nactivities on the basis of sex, the Title IX Coordinator may initiate a\ncomplaint. Where the complainant remains committed to the requests above, and\nthe prohibited conduct does not fall under Section 12.0, but only under 13.0,\nthe Title IX Coordinator may elect to pursue action on Caltech\u2019s behalf\nwithout considering these factors.\n\nIf Caltech determines that it can honor the student\u2019s request for\nconfidentiality, it shall still take reasonable steps to respond to the\ncomplaint, consistent with the request, to limit the effects of the alleged\nprohibited conduct and prevent its recurrence without initiating formal action\nagainst the alleged respondent or revealing the identity of the complainant.\nThese steps may include increased monitoring, supervision, or security at\nlocations or activities where the alleged misconduct occurred; providing\nadditional training and education materials for students and employees; or\nconducting climate surveys regarding sexual violence. The Institute shall also\ntake immediate steps to provide for the safety of the complainant while\nkeeping the complainant\u2019s identity confidential as appropriate. These steps\nmay include changing living arrangements or course schedules, assignments, or\ntests. The complainant shall be notified that the steps Caltech will take to\nrespond to the complaint will be limited by the request for confidentiality.\n\nIf Caltech determines that it must disclose the complainant\u2019s identity to the\nrespondent or proceed with an investigation and a complaint is initiated by\nthe Title IX Coordinator, the complainant will be notified prior to disclosing\nthe complainant\u2019s name or initiating the investigation. Caltech will take\nappropriate steps to address reasonable concerns about the safety of the\ncomplainant and others, including providing supportive measures. The\ncomplainant is not required to participate in the ensuing process. Caltech\nshall also take immediate steps to provide for the safety of the complainant\nwhere appropriate. In the event the complainant requests that Caltech inform\nthe respondent that the student asked Caltech not to investigate or seek\ndiscipline, Caltech shall honor this request.\n\nWhether or not a complaint is initiated by the Title IX Coordinator, the Title\nIX Coordinator shall still take reasonable steps to ensure that the alleged\nsex discrimination does not continue or reoccur and to limit its effects.\nThese steps may include increased monitoring, supervision, or security at\nlocations or activities where the alleged misconduct occurred; providing\nadditional training and education materials for students and employees; or\nconducting climate surveys regarding sexual violence. The Institute shall also\ntake immediate steps to provide for the safety of the complainant while\nkeeping the complainant\u2019s identity confidential as appropriate. These steps\nmay include changing living arrangements or course schedules, assignments, or\ntests. The complainant shall be notified that the steps Caltech will take to\nrespond to the complaint will be limited by the request for confidentiality.\n\nIf the complaint includes allegations that may constitute a possible crime,\nthe Title IX Coordinator will notify the complainant of their right to file a\ncriminal complaint or to choose not to notify law enforcement. As stated above\nin Section 5.5, Caltech does not report sex-based harassment to law\nenforcement on a complainant\u2019s behalf, unless such a report is mandated by law\n(e.g., sexual assault of a person under 18). If the complainant chooses to\nnotify law enforcement, they may seek the assistance of the Equity and Title\nIX Office to facilitate contact with law enforcement and the scheduling of a\nmeeting to make a report.\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator, depending on facts and circumstances, may also elect\nto file a formal complaint and initiate an investigation even if the\ncomplainant does have the standing to do so.\n\nFormal complaints may be filed even if a complainant elects not to notify law\nenforcement and/or pursue a criminal complaint.\n\nAll final determinations and decisions taken under this provision 10.0, except\nthe complainant\u2019s decision to file a criminal complaint or to choose not to\nnotify law enforcement, rest solely with the Title IX Coordinator.\n\n##  10.0 Contacting Government Agencies\n\nEmployees, students, and others participating in Caltech\u2019s educational\nprograms or activities may direct questions regarding Title IX to or file\ncomplaints with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights,\n(415) 486-5555, [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-\nprotection#234c40510d50424d4551424d404a50404c6346470d444c55), or (800)\n421-3481, [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-\nprotection#18575b4a587d7c367f776e). In addition, employees may file complaints\nwith the California Civil Rights Department at [dfeh.ca.gov/contact-\nus](http://dfeh.ca.gov/contact-us) or the United States Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) at [eeoc.gov](http://eeoc.gov). Complaints can\nalso be directed to the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education at\n[bppe.ca.gov](http://bppe.ca.gov).\n\nNASA-funded program participants may file a complaint at [[email\nprotected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or find more information at\n[missionstem.nasa.gov/filing-a-\ncomplaint.html](http://missionstem.nasa.gov/filing-a-complaint.html). NSF-\nfunded program participants may file a complaint with the Office of Diversity\nand Inclusion at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-\nprotection#0d7d7f626a7f6c606e62607d616c6463797e4d637e6b236a627b), (703)\n292-8020, or find more information at [new.nsf.gov/stopping-\nharassment](https://new.nsf.gov/stopping-harassment). Participants in programs\nfunded by other federal agencies providing federal financial assistance to\nCaltech may file directly with those agencies. Filing a complaint with a\nfederal agency under Title IX must be done within 180 days of an alleged\ndiscriminatory or harassing event, and there is no requirement to exhaust\nremedies through (i.e., utilize or go through) Caltech\u2019s internal procedures\nbefore filing directly with a federal agency.\n\n##  11.0 Clery Reporting\n\nThe federal Clery Act requires Caltech to issue an [Annual Security and Fire\nSafety Report](https://security.caltech.edu/our-mission/annual-security-and-\nfire-safety-report), which includes crime statistics for sexual assault (rape,\nfondling, incest, and statutory rape), domestic violence, dating violence, and\nstalking. Campus Security gathers these crime statistics from the Equity and\nTitle IX Office, security reports, Pasadena Police Department information,\nJPL, and reports by Campus Security authorities. Crime statistics do not\ndisclose any identifying information about the complainant, respondent,\nwitnesses, or others and do not disclose any details of the incident. For more\ninformation and statistics for the past three years, see the current [Annual\nSecurity and Fire Safety Report](https://security.caltech.edu/our-\nmission/annual-security-and-fire-safety-report).\n\n##  SECTION III: PROHIBITED CONDUCT\n\n##  12.0 Prohibited Conduct\n\nThis section sets out what conduct is prohibited under this policy (prohibited\nconduct). Reported behavior that does not constitute prohibited conduct under\nthis policy but is nevertheless determined to be inappropriate may still\nsubject the offending individual to disciplinary or other sanctions.\n\n###  12.1 Definition of Sex Discrimination\n\nSex discrimination is different treatment with respect to an individual\u2019s\nemployment or participation in an education program or activity based, in\nwhole or in part, upon the individual\u2019s actual or perceived sex or gender.\nDiscrimination also includes allegations of a failure to provide reasonable\naccommodation for pregnancy or related conditions as required by law or\npolicy. Sex discrimination includes unfavorable treatment on the basis of sex,\ngender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, sex\nstereotypes, and sex characteristics,.\n\nGender expression means a person\u2019s gender-related appearance and behavior,\nwhether or not stereotypically associated with the person\u2019s assigned sex at\nbirth.\n\n###  12.2 Retaliation\n\nRetaliation, including peer retaliation, against any member of the Caltech\ncommunity is strictly prohibited. Retaliation means intimidation, threats,\ncoercion, or discrimination against any person by the recipient, a student, an\nemployee or other person authorized by the Caltech to provide aid, benefit, or\nservice under Caltech\u2019s education program or activity for exercising any right\nor privilege secured by Title IX or its regulations or other applicable\nFederal or State laws, including reporting information, making a complaint,\ntestifying, assisting, or otherwise participating or refusing to participate\nin any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this Policy or\nthe procedures. Threats of retaliatory action also constitute retaliation.\nRetaliation violates this policy and is unlawful.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Caltech may require employees or other person\nauthorized by Caltech to provide aid, benefit, or service under Caltech\u2019s\neducation program or activity to participate as a witness in, or otherwise\nassist with, an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part.\n\n###  12.3 Definition of Sex-Based Harassment under Title IX\n\nSex-based harassment is a form of sex discrimination and means sexual\nharassment and other harassment on the basis of sex, including on the basis of\nsex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, sexual\norientation, and gender identity, that meets one or both of the following: (1)\nan employee, agent, or other representative of Caltech conditions the\nprovision of an aid, benefit, or service on a person\u2019s participation in\nunwelcome sexual conduct; or (2) unwelcome sex-based conduct that, based on\nthe totality of the circumstances, is subjectively and objectively offensive\nand is so severe or pervasive that it limits or denies a person\u2019s ability to\nparticipate in or benefit from the recipient\u2019s education program or activity\n(\u201chostile environment harassment\u201d); or (3) specific offenses, including sexual\nassault; dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking as defined below.\n\nWhether a hostile environment has been created is a fact-specific inquiry that\nincludes consideration of the following:\n\n  * The degree to which the conduct affected the complainant\u2019s ability to access the education program or activity;\n  * The type, frequency, and duration of the conduct;\n  * The parties\u2019 ages, roles within the recipient\u2019s education program or activity, previous interactions, and other factors about each party that may be relevant to evaluating the effects of the conduct;\n  * The location of the conduct and the context in which the conduct occurred; and\n  * Other sex-based harassment in the recipient\u2019s education program or activity.\n\n**12.3.1** Sexual assault means an offense classified as a sex offense under\nthe uniform crime reporting system of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as\nfollows:\n\n_Rape:_ The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any\nbody part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person,\nwithout the consent of the victim. This definition excludes statutory rape.\n\n_Fondling:_ The touching of the private body parts of another person for the\npurpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including\nin instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of\nhis/her youth or because of his/her temporary or permanent mental or physical\nincapacity.\n\nFor purposes of this policy, the term private body parts includes breast,\ngenitals, groin, anus, or buttocks.\n\nCaltech interprets fondling to include potentially, depending on the facts and\ncircumstances, (a) the disrobing or exposure of another without their consent,\nand (b) the touching of another person\u2019s private body parts for the purpose of\nsexual gratification without consent through clothing, as well as directly.\n\n_Incest:_ Sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other\nwithin the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law.\n\n_Statutory Rape:_ Sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory\nage of consent, which in California is eighteen (18).\n\n**12.3.2** Dating, and Domestic Violence\n\nDating violence means violence committed by a person who is or has been in a\nsocial relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with a complainant. The\nexistence of such a relationship shall be determined based on the\ncomplainant\u2019s statement as well as consideration of the length of the\nrelationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction\nbetween the persons involved in the relationship. Dating violence includes,\nbut is not limited to, sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse.\nDating violence does not include acts covered under the definition of domestic\nviolence.\n\nDomestic violence means conduct, on the basis of sex, that constitutes a\nfelony or misdemeanor crime of violence committed upon a victim who is (a) the\noffender\u2019s spouse or former spouse, (b) the offender\u2019s cohabitant or former\ncohabitant; or (c) the offender\u2019s fianc\u00e9 or fianc\u00e9e, or someone with whom the\noffender has, or previously had, an engagement or dating relationship; (d) the\nparent of the offender\u2019s child; or (e) any other victim who is protected under\nthe domestic or family violence laws of the state where the domestic violence\noccurred.\n\n**12.3.3** Stalking means engaging in a course of conduct directed at a\nspecific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for his or her\nsafety or the safety of others; or suffer substantial emotional distress.\n\n\u201cCourse of conduct\u201d means two or more acts, including, but not limited to,\nacts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by\nany action, method, device, or means, follows, monitors, observes, surveils,\nthreatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with the\nperson\u2019s property.\n\n\u201cReasonable person\u201d means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and\nwith similar legally protected or other characteristics to the victim.\n\nStalking is also covered by the Violence Prevention Policy and should be\nreported to the Equity and Title IX Office and Security at campus or the\nProtective Services Office at JPL.\n\n###  12.4 Definition of Sex-based Harassment under California law\n\nSexual harassment (\u201csex-based harassment) means unwelcome sexual advances,\nrequests for sexual favors, and other verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a\nsexual nature, made by someone from or in the work or educational setting,\nunder any of the following conditions:\n\n  1. Submission to the conduct is explicitly or implicitly made a term or a condition of an individual\u2019s employment, academic status, or progress.\n  2. Submission to, or rejection of, the conduct by the individual is used as the basis of employment or academic decisions affecting the individual.\n  3. The conduct has the purpose or effect of having a negative impact upon the individual\u2019s work or academic performance, or of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work or educational environment.  \nVerbal sexual harassment includes but is not limited to unwelcome epithets,\ncomments, or slurs of a sexual nature.  \nVisual sexual harassment includes but is not limited to derogatory posters,\ncartoons, drawings, obscene gestures, or computer-generated images of a sexual\nnature.  \nPhysical sexual harassment includes but is not limited to assault, impeding,\nor blocking movement, or any other physical interference with work or academic\nactivities or movement when directed against an individual on the basis of\nsex.  \nWhen an individual sexually harasses a student, the harassing conduct creates\na hostile environment on campus for the purposes of this section if the\nconduct is sufficiently serious that it interferes with or limits a student\u2019s\nability to participate in or benefit from the institution\u2019s programs or\nactivities. The more severe the conduct, the less need there is to show a\nrepetitive series of incidents to prove a hostile environment on campus,\nparticularly if the harassment is physical. A single or isolated incident of\nsexual harassment, including sexual violence, may create a hostile environment\non campus if the incident is sufficiently severe.\n\n  4. Submission to, or rejection of, the conduct by the individual is used as the basis for any decision affecting the individual regarding benefits and services, honors, programs, or activities available at or through the educational institution.\n  5. Sexual violence, which means physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person without the person\u2019s affirmative consent, including rape and sexual battery.\n  6. Rape, which is defined as penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any part or object, or oral copulation of a sex organ by another person, without the consent of the victim.\n  7. Sexual battery, which means the (a) intentional touching, directly or through clothing, of another person\u2019s intimate parts without consent, (b) intentionally causing a person to touch the intimate parts of another, directly or through clothing, without consent, or (c) using a person\u2019s own intimate part to intentionally touch another person\u2019s body, directly or through clothing, without consent.  \nIntimate body parts are the breast, genitals, groin, anus, or buttocks\n\n  8. Sexual exploitation, which means a person taking sexual advantage of another person for the benefit of anyone other than that person without that person\u2019s consent, including, but not limited to, any of the following acts:\n    1. The prostituting of another person.\n    2. The trafficking of another person, defined as the inducement of a person to perform a commercial sex act, or labor or services, through force, fraud, or coercion.\n    3. The recording of images, including video or photograph, or audio of another person\u2019s sexual activity or intimate parts,  \nwithout that person\u2019s consent.\n\n    4. The distribution of images, including video or photograph, or audio of another person\u2019s sexual activity or intimate parts, if the individual distributing the images or audio knows or should have known that the person depicted in the images or audio did not consent to the disclosure.\n    5. The viewing of another person\u2019s sexual activity or intimate parts, in a place where that other person would have a reasonable expectation of privacy, without that person\u2019s consent, for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire.\n\n###  12.5 Affirmative Consent\n\nConsent is a key component of various definitions of prohibited conduct.\nAffirmative consent is the standard of consent in Caltech\u2019s policy.\nAffirmative consent is the affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to\nengage in sexual activity. A minor under the age of eighteen (18) is deemed to\nbe incapable of providing affirmative consent under this policy.\n\n  * It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that they have the affirmative consent of the other person(s) to engage in the sexual activity.\n  * Lack of protest or resistance does not mean consent, nor does silence mean consent.\n  * Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and each time sexual activity is engaged in, and it can be revoked at any time. Consent to one form of sexual activity is not, by itself, consent to other forms of sexual activity.\n  * The existence of a dating relationship between the people involved, or the fact of any past sexual activity between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of consent.\n\nIt is not a valid excuse, including in the evaluation of complaints in any\nresolution process, in response to an alleged lack of affirmative consent that\nthe respondent believed that the complainant consented to the sexual activity\nunder either of the following circumstances:\n\n  * The respondent\u2019s belief in affirmative consent arose from the intoxication or recklessness of the respondent.\n  * The respondent did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the respondent at the time, to ascertain whether the complainant affirmatively consented.\n\nIt is not a valid excuse that the respondent believed that the complainant\naffirmatively consented to the sexual activity if the respondent knew or\nreasonably should have known that the complainant was unable to consent to the\nsexual activity under any of the following circumstances:\n\n  * The complainant was asleep or unconscious.\n  * The complainant was incapacitated due to the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medication, so that the complainant could not understand the fact, nature, or extent of the sexual activity.\n  * The complainant was unable to communicate due to a mental or physical condition.\n\nA person who is incapacitated is not capable of giving effective consent to\nsexual activity. An incapacitated person lacks the physical and mental\ncapacity to make informed, reasonable judgments about whether or not to engage\nin sexual activity. A person who is incapacitated may not be able to\nunderstand where they are, whom they are with, how they got there, or what is\nhappening.\n\nA person may be incapacitated by a temporary or permanent mental or physical\ncondition, sleep, or unconsciousness. A person may also be incapacitated as a\nresult of voluntary or involuntary (e.g., induced, forced) consumption of\nalcohol or drugs. Incapacitation is a state beyond mere intoxication or\ndrunkenness. Just because someone is under the influence of alcohol or drugs\ndoes not necessarily mean that a person is incapacitated. Impairment must be\nsignificant enough to render a person unable to understand the fact, nature,\nor extent of the sexual activity. In evaluating affirmative consent in cases\ninvolving an allegation of incapacitation, Caltech considers the state and\ndegree of intoxication of the reporting party and the knowledge of the\nrespondent.\n\nOne\u2019s own intoxication, even to the point of incapacitation, does not relieve\nan individual from responsibility for a policy violation when they engage in\nsexual conduct without the affirmative consent of the other party or parties.\nHowever, a respondent who was incapacitated during sexual conduct has the\nright to file a formal complaint alleging they were incapacitated and unable\nto consent to the reported sexual activity.\n\n**12.5.1** Limitation on Claiming Consent as a Defense to Sex- Based\nHarassment\n\nWhen a consensual personal relationship arises and a power differential\nexists, Caltech does not consider consent as a defense to a claim of sex-based\nharassment. The individual in the relationship with greater power will be held\nresponsible.\n\n##  13.0 Additional Conduct Prohibited by Caltech\n\n###  13.1 Complicity\n\nComplicity is any act that knowingly aids, facilitates, promotes, or\nencourages the commission of Prohibited Conduct by another person.\n\n###  13.2 Violation of a Caltech Directive\n\nAny individual may be found in violation for failure to comply with a Caltech\ndirective regarding a supportive measure (e.g., violating the terms of a\nMutual No-Contact Order).\n\n###  13.3 Prohibition on Relationships between Employees and Undergraduates\n\nThis policy prohibits sexual or romantic relationships between an\nundergraduate student and a faculty member, postdoctoral scholar, or staff\nmember. Any Responsible Employee who becomes aware of such a relationship is\nexpected to report it immediately to the Title IX Coordinator. The non-\nundergraduate party in the relationship will be held responsible for\nprohibited conduct violating this policy, regardless of whether a complaint is\nfiled.\n\n###  13.4 Prohibition on Evaluative Responsibilities in Certain Circumstances\n\nEven when relationships are consensual, care must be taken to eliminate the\npotential for harassment or other conflicts. Caltech practice prohibits\nindividuals, including Teaching Assistants, from participating in evaluating\nthe work or academic performance of those with whom they have romantic and/or\nsexual relationships, or from making hiring, salary, or similar decisions\nregarding those individuals. Upon learning about a consensual relationship\ninvolving such a power differential, the supervisor, dean, or division chair\nshould immediately notify the Title IX Coordinator and, in consultation with\nthe Title IX Coordinator, should review and remedy any direct administrative\nor academic relationship between the involved individuals. The individual with\ngreater power may be subject to disciplinary action for a violation of this\nprohibition.\n\n###  13.5 Prohibition on Inequitable Treatment Stemming from Consensual\nRelationships\n\nAs previously noted, even when relationships are consensual, care must be\ntaken to eliminate the potential for harassment or other conflicts. If a\nconsensual relationship exists, it is not acceptable to treat the individual\nin the relationship more favorably than other similarly situated individuals\nin the context of employment or academic performance.\n\n###  13.6 Prohibition on Uncompleted Attempts or Threats of Prohibited Conduct\n\nTo the extent that uncompleted attempts or threats of prohibited conduct are\nnot covered in Sections 12.0 of this policy, they are covered here. Threats of\nprohibited conduct may also constitute retaliation under this policy.\n\n###  13.7 General Caution about Maintaining Appropriate Professional\nBoundaries\n\nAll members of the Caltech community should maintain respectful and\nprofessional boundaries with one another. This is particularly important when\nCaltech employees, whether faculty, postdoctoral scholars, or staff, interact\nwith their subordinates, or with graduate and undergraduate students, due to\nthe power differential that exists between them.\n\nWhile certain conduct may not constitute prohibited conduct, it can create\nsituations where students or others feel uncomfortable but reluctant to voice\nthat sentiment.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, such situations may include hosting students\nat private homes, sharing lodging on academic-related trips (e.g.,\nconferences, field trips), wearing swimsuits (e.g., marine research outing),\nand any interaction where alcohol is consumed (e.g., dinners at conferences,\nfield trips, holiday parties).\n\nCaltech encourages employees and other community members to think carefully\nabout maintaining appropriate professional boundaries at all times, to state\ntheir boundaries as appropriate, and to consider seeking guidance from the\nTitle IX Coordinator.\n\n##  14.0 Informational Resources\n\nInformation on prohibited conduct, as well as copies of Caltech\u2019s Sex\nDiscrimination; Nondiscrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity; Unlawful\nHarassment; and Violence Prevention policies are available from the following\nresources:\n\nAt Campus: Caltech\u2019s Title IX Coordinator and deputy Title IX Coordinators,\nCaltech\u2019s EO Coordinators, Human Resources, Student Affairs, the Deans\u2019\nOffices, the Caltech Center for Inclusion and Diversity, Resident Associates,\nthe Staff and Faculty Consultation Center, and Employee and Organizational\nDevelopment.\n\nAt JPL: JPL\u2019s deputy Title IX Coordinator, EO Coordinator, and Human Resources\nBusiness Partners.\n\nThe policies are published in the [Caltech\nCatalog](http://catalog.caltech.edu/current) and on the following Caltech and\nJPL websites: [JPL Human Resources](https://hr.jpl.nasa.gov/), [Equity and\nTitle IX Office](https://titleix.caltech.edu/), and [Student\nAffairs](https://studentaffairs.caltech.edu/).\n\nRelated Policies and Procedures:\n\n  * Procedures for Complaints of Sex Discrimination (Interim Procedures are available from the Equity and Title IX Office)\n  * [Nondiscrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2647/caltech_institute_policy-nondiscrmination_and_equal_opportunity_employment.pdf)\n  * [Unlawful Harassment and Abusive Conduct Policy](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2641/caltech_institute_policy-unlawful_harassment.pdf)\n  * [Procedures for Complaints of Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2704/caltech_institute_procedure-procedures_for_complaints_of_unlawful_discrimination_harassment_and_retaliation.pdf)\n  * [Violence Prevention Policy](http://www.hr.caltech.edu/documents/186-pm34.pdf)\n\n"

        "content": "##  I. Introduction and Scope\n\nCaltech\u2019s Sex Discrimination Policy (policy) makes clear that sex\ndiscrimination and other conduct prohibited under the policy (prohibited\nconduct) will not be tolerated. These procedures are designed to support the\nprompt and appropriate response by Caltech to reports of prohibited conduct,\nin a fair and impartial manner.\n\nCaltech has adopted these grievance procedures (procedure) to provide for the\nprompt and equitable resolution of complaints of prohibited conduct made by\nstudents, employees, or other individuals who are participating or attempting\nto participate in its education program or activities, as well as complaints\ninitiated by Caltech\u2019s Title IX Coordinator.\n\nInformation about reporting options is available in the Sex Discrimination\nPolicy. These procedures apply to address allegations of prohibited conduct,\nincluding retaliation, which occurred on or after August 1, 2024, and fall\nwithin the scope of Caltech\u2019s Sex Discrimination Policy.\n\nThroughout these procedures, any reference to a Caltech or JPL administrator\nis understood to include not only that administrator but also their designee.\n\n##  II. Advisors\n\nIn cases involving complaints of sex-based harassment, involving students, the\ncomplainant and respondent may have an advisor or support person (hereinafter,\ncollectively, \u201cadvisor\u201d) of their choice, which may be but is not required to\nbe an attorney, accompany and generally support them at any virtual or live\nmeetings or phone calls at any point in the procedures. However, Caltech\u2019s\nresolution processes, including the investigation process, are not legal\nproceedings and the advisor may not speak or submit written statements on\nbehalf of the individual they are advising. Caltech will not be responsible\nfor communicating information to advisors. Advisors are required to sign and\nabide by Caltech\u2019s Advisor Policy setting forth the parameters of their role.\n\nCaltech is not required to identify or provide advisors to parties, but the\nTitle IX Coordinator will assist parties to identify potential advisors upon\nrequest.\n\n##  III. Timelines\n\nThese procedures set out reasonably prompt time frames for major procedural\nstages: initial assessment, investigation, determination, and appeal, if any.\nTime frames for each major procedural stage are specified in the sections of\nthis document referencing each of these procedural stages.\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator, at their own discretion or upon the request of a\nparty or witness, may extend a time frame for good cause, providing prompt\nwritten notice to the parties of any delays or extensions and the reasons\ntherefor.\n\nGood cause may include but is not limited to the absence of a party, a party\u2019s\nadvisor, or a witness; concurrent law enforcement activity; the need for\nlanguage assistance or accommodation of disabilities; the breadth and scope of\nthe allegations, the number of potential witnesses, the amount of evidence,\nand school and office closures.\n\nParties must communicate requests for extensions in writing to the Title IX\nCoordinator before deadlines have passed, to the extent practicable.\n\nWhere an individual asks for adjustments to timelines based on an\naccommodation of a medical condition or disability, they will be required to\nfollow the applicable Institute disability accommodation process in requesting\nan accommodation, as described in the Institute Disability and Reasonable\nAccommodation Policy or appropriate student accessibility services process.\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator shall not unreasonably deny a party\u2019s request for an\nextension of a deadline related to a complaint during periods of examinations\nor school closures.\n\n##  IV. Initial Title IX Assessment and Response\n\nUpon receiving a report of prohibited conduct, Caltech\u2019s Title IX Coordinator\nwill respond promptly and effectively. Within fourteen (14) business days, the\nTitle IX Coordinator will make an initial assessment of the report to\ndetermine whether the allegations on their face present a potential violation\nof the Sex Discrimination Policy; or, if not, whether they should be addressed\nunder a different Caltech policy and process. Within that time frame, the\nTitle IX Coordinator will also make a reasonable assessment of any safety\nconcerns posed to any member of the Caltech community or Caltech\u2019s campus and\ndetermine whether emergency removal or administrative leave is warranted.\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator or other member of the Equity and Title IX Office\nwill promptly contact the complainant to inform them of:\n\n  * the availability of supportive measures and other resources:\n  * the options for resolving the complaint, including information regarding the investigation procedures and any informal resolution processes offered;\n  * the availability of confidential resources both on and off campus;\n  * the importance of preserving evidence and identifying witnesses and their locations;\n  * their right to file a police report if the reported conduct could be a crime\n  * Caltech\u2019s policy prohibiting retaliation for making a good-faith report of prohibited conduct or participating or refusing to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or process conducted by Caltech under these procedures.\n\nIf the Title IX Coordinator determines that the reported conduct on its face\ndoes not fall within the scope of Title IX, the Title IX Coordinator will\ninform the complainant that the matter may be referred to another Caltech\nprocess. Even if the matter is not within the jurisdiction of the Title IX\nOffice, the complainant will still be offered supportive measures if\nappropriate.\n\nIf the Title IX Coordinator or other member of the Equity and Title IX Office\ncontacts the respondent about the complaint, initiates an investigation, or\noffers any informal resolution processes to complainant, the respondent will\nbe provided with the following:\n\n  * the availability of supportive measures and other resources:\n  * the options for resolving the complaint, including information regarding the investigation procedures and any informal resolution processes offered;\n  * the availability of confidential resources both on and off campus;\n  * the importance of preserving evidence and identifying witnesses and their locations;\n  * Caltech\u2019s policy prohibiting retaliation for making a good-faith report of prohibited conduct or participating or refusing to participate in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or process conducted by Caltech under these procedures.\n\n##  V. Supportive Measures\n\nSupportive measures are measures that are offered to the parties and\ncoordinated by the Title IX Coordinator, as appropriate. Supportive measures\nmay be offered before or after the filing of a complaint and are available\nwhether or not a complaint is made or an investigation is initiated. They are\ndesigned to restore or preserve equal access to Caltech\u2019s education programs\nand activities, to protect the safety of the parties, and to provide support\nduring the investigation or other resolution process. Supportive measures must\nnot unreasonably burden the other party and may not be imposed for punitive or\ndisciplinary reasons.\n\nSupportive measures may include counseling, academic accommodations (e.g.,\nextensions of deadlines, course-related adjustments), modifications of work or\nclass schedules, campus escort services, increased security and monitoring of\ncertain areas of campus, restrictions on contact applied to one or more\nparties, including in a virtual or electronic environment, changes in work or\nhousing locations, leaves of absence, changes in class, work, housing or\nextracurricular or other activity, referrals to campus and off-campus support\nresources, and other similar measures.\n\nCaltech will maintain as confidential any supportive measures provided to any\nparty to the extent such confidentiality does not impair Caltech\u2019s ability to\nprovide the supportive measures (e.g., notifying appropriate administrators\ninvolved in academic accommodations). The Title IX Coordinator will coordinate\nthe effective implementation of supportive measures. Academic accommodations\nshould be requested in a timely manner, reasonably in advance of deadlines.\nRetroactive accommodations, such as re-taking tests or extensions after the\ndue date has passed, will not be granted.\n\nSupportive measures affecting faculty, postdoctoral scholars, and staff,\nincluding employees at JPL, might include transfer of supervisory or\nevaluative responsibility regarding grading, supervision, tenure review,\nletters of recommendation, and/or changes to office assignments.\n\nCaltech will endeavor to minimize the burden on the party receiving supportive\nmeasures without unreasonably burdening the other party. If a complainant\nwishes to seek a temporary restraining order or similar judicial order,\nCaltech will help the complainant with that process. Parties may seek the\nassistance of the Campus Sexual Violence Advocate, who can be contacted\ndirectly or through the Equity and Title IX Office.\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator will consider and make determinations regarding\nrequests by the parties for supportive measures. If a party disagrees with the\nTitle IX Coordinator\u2019s decision concerning a supportive measure, they may\nappeal the decision by submitting an appeal of the decision in writing to the\nassociate vice president for human resources within seven (7) business days of\nthe denial. The decision of the associate vice president for human resources\nis final.\n\nThe imposition of supportive measures is not indicative of a determination of\nresponsibility or any other outcome. These measures may be modified at any\ntime and may be kept in place after a final investigative decision is reached.\nCaltech will provide parties with the opportunity to seek modifications or\nterminations of supportive measures applicable to them if circumstances change\nmaterially.\n\nAll parties are expected to comply with any supportive measures that may be\nimposed. Failure to comply with supportive measures may be grounds for\ndisciplinary action. A party may be subject to discipline under the\nappropriate Caltech policy for failure to comply with a supportive measure\neven if they are found not responsible for the underlying report of prohibited\nconduct.\n\n##  VI. Emergency Removal\n\nA respondent may be subject to removal from a Caltech education program or\nactivity on an emergency basis consistent with the following process. The\nTitle IX Coordinator will undertake an individualized safety and risk analysis\nfor the purpose of determining whether the respondent, based on the alleged\nconduct, is an imminent and serious threat to the health or safety of a\ncomplainant or any students, employees, or other person arising from the\nallegations of sex discrimination, justifying their removal from campus or\nother appropriate scope of removal. The Title IX Coordinator may consult with\nany individuals they consider pertinent and appropriate to making the\nemergency removal determination. The safety and risk factors that the Title IX\nCoordinator will consider include but are not limited to the nature of the\nallegations, the alleged number and age of the complainant(s), the power\ndifferential between the respondent and complainant(s), whether the respondent\nis alleged to have used a weapon, violence, drugs, or alcohol to intimidate,\nharm, or control a complainant, and whether the allegations present a pattern\nof behavior or otherwise suggest a likelihood of repeated misconduct.\n\nWhere the Title IX Coordinator has determined that emergency removal of a\nstudent respondent is appropriate, the respondent will be provided with notice\nand an opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following the\nremoval. To challenge a removal decision by the Title IX Coordinator, the\nrespondent must submit a written appeal to the associate vice president for\nhuman resources within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of notice. In\ndeciding this appeal, the associate vice president for human resources may\nconsult with any individuals they consider pertinent and appropriate to making\nthe decision. The decision of the associate vice president for human resources\nis final.\n\nPrior to the beginning of a new term, an individual who has been subject to\nemergency removal may request that the Title IX Coordinator reconsider the\nscope or continuation of their removal.\n\nCaltech may place nonstudent employee respondents on administrative leave\nwhile a complaint resolution process is pending.\n\n##  VII. Complainant\u2019s Ability to Exercise Options\n\nWith respect to allegations of prohibited conduct under the Sex Discrimination\nPolicy, the Title IX Coordinator and deputy coordinators make every effort to\nrespect the concerns and goals of complainants, as well as their capacity to\nmake independent choices regarding resolution options for addressing their\ncomplaints under the Policy and these procedures.\n\nIn instances where a complainant requests that their name not be used, that\nCaltech not pursue any action against the respondent, including an\ninvestigation, or that no disciplinary action be taken, Caltech will seriously\nconsider the request but weigh the request against Caltech\u2019s responsibilities,\nincluding under applicable laws, to take action to provide a safe,\nnonthreatening, and nondiscriminatory environment for all community members,\nincluding the complainant. The Title IX Coordinator will discuss with the\ncomplainant the reasons for their requests and attempt to address the\nunderlying concerns, such as taking steps to prevent retaliation.\n\nWhere the complainant request that no investigation or process be initiated,\nand the alleged prohibited conduct constitutes sex discrimination prohibited\nunder Title IX, the Title IX Coordinator will determine whether to initiate a\ncomplaint. In making this determination, the Title IX Coordinator will make a\nfact-specific determination, considering factors that the Title IX Coordinator\nconsiders relevant, including but not limited to, the complainant\u2019s request\nnot to proceed with the initiation of a complaint, the complainant\u2019s\nreasonable safety concerns regarding the initiation of a complaint, the risk\nthat additional acts of sex discrimination would occur if a complaint is not\ninitiated, the nature and seriousness of the alleged conduct, including\nwhether the discrimination if established would require removal of the\nrespondent from campus or other disciplinary sanction to end the\ndiscrimination and prevent its recurrence, the age and relationship of the\nparties, including whether respondent is an employee, the scope of the alleged\ndiscrimination, including information suggesting a pattern, ongoing sex\ndiscrimination, or sex discrimination involving multiple individuals, and\nwhether Caltech is able to conduct a thorough investigation and obtain\nrelevant evidence in the absence of the complainant\u2019s cooperation. If the\nprohibited conduct does not fall under Title IX, the Title IX Coordinator may\nelect to pursue action on Caltech\u2019s behalf despite the complainant\u2019s wishes\nwithout considering these factors.\n\nIf Caltech determines that it can honor the complainant\u2019s request for\nconfidentiality, it shall still take reasonable steps to respond to the\ncomplaint, consistent with the request, to limit the effects of the alleged\nprohibited conduct and prevent its recurrence without initiating formal action\nagainst the alleged respondent or revealing the identity of the complainant.\nThese steps may include increased monitoring, supervision, or security at\nlocations or activities where the alleged misconduct occurred; providing\nadditional training and education materials for students and employees; or\nconducting climate surveys regarding sexual violence. The Institute shall also\ntake immediate steps to provide for the safety of the complainant while\nkeeping the complainant\u2019s identity confidential as appropriate. These steps\nmay include changing living arrangements or course schedules, assignments, or\ntests. The complainant shall be notified that the steps Caltech will take to\nrespond to the complaint will be limited by the request for confidentiality.\n\nIf Caltech determines that it must disclose the complainant\u2019s identity to the\nrespondent or proceed with an investigation, it shall inform the complainant\nprior to making this disclosure or initiating the investigation. The\ncomplainant is not required to participate in the ensuing process. Caltech\nshall also take immediate steps to provide for the safety of the complainant\nwhere appropriate, including providing supportive measures. In the event the\ncomplainant requests that Caltech inform the respondent that the complainant\nasked Caltech not to investigate or seek discipline, Caltech shall honor this\nrequest.\n\nIf the complaint includes allegations that may constitute a possible crime,\nthe Title IX Coordinator will notify the complainant of their right to file a\ncriminal complaint or to choose not to notify law enforcement. Caltech does\nnot report sex- and gender-based misconduct to law enforcement on a\ncomplainant\u2019s behalf, unless such a report is mandated by law (e.g., sexual\nassault of a person under 18, de-identified reporting as required under\nCalifornia Education Code Section 67383). If the complainant chooses to notify\nlaw enforcement, they may seek the assistance of the Equity and Title IX\nOffice. The Equity and Title IX Office will facilitate the contact with law\nenforcement and the scheduling of a meeting, if the complainant chooses to\nmake a report.\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator, depending on facts and circumstances, may also elect\nto file a complaint, even if the complainant elects not to do so or does not\nhave standing to do so.\n\nWhere the Title IX Coordinator files a complaint, the complainant would still\nbe treated as a party with all associated rights parties have under the\ncomplaint resolution procedures, as set out below.\n\nComplaints may be filed even if a complainant elects not to notify law\nenforcement and/or pursue a criminal complaint.\n\nDecisions by the Title IX Coordinator to file or not to file a complaint are\nwithin the Title IX Coordinator\u2019s sole discretion and are not subject to\nappeal.\n\n##  VIII. Complaints\n\nThe following individuals have the right to make a complaint of sex\ndiscrimination, including complaints of sex-based harassment, and to request\nthat Caltech investigate and make a determination about alleged discrimination\ncovered under these procedures:\n\n  * a student or employee who is alleged to have been subjected to conduct that could constitute sex discrimination under the Caltech\u2019s Sex Discrimination Policy; or\n  * a person other than a student or employee who is alleged to have been subjected to conduct that could constitute sex discrimination under the Policy and who was participating or attempting to participate in a Caltech education program or activity at the time of the alleged sex discrimination.\n\nThe term \u201cattempting to participate\u201d includes when a complainant has: (a)\napplied for admission; (b) graduated but intends to apply for a new program;\n(c) graduated but intends to participate in alumni programs and activities;\n(d) gone on leave but is still enrolled; (e) gone on leave but intends to re-\napply after the leave; or (f) withdrawn due to alleged sexual harassment and\nexpresses a desire to re-enroll if Caltech responds appropriately to the\nallegations.\n\nUnder Caltech\u2019s Sex Discrimination Policy, conduct occurring under Caltech\u2019s\neducation program or activity includes but is not limited to prohibited\nconduct that occurs in locations, at events, or in circumstances in which the\nCaltech exercises substantial control over both the respondent and the context\nin which the conduct occurred, in a building owned or controlled by a student\norganization that is officially recognized by Caltech, and conduct that is\notherwise subject to Caltech\u2019s disciplinary authority. Caltech has an\nobligation to address a sex-based hostile environment under its education\nprogram or activity, even when some conduct alleged to be contributing to the\nhostile environment occurred outside Caltech\u2019s education program or activity\nor outside the United States. For reports of conduct occurring off-campus, the\nTitle IX Coordinator will determine whether the alleged prohibited conduct\noccurred in a Caltech education program or activity.\n\nHowever, even if a complainant is not qualified to bring a complaint, the\nrespondent is outside the jurisdiction of Caltech\u2019s policy, or the alleged\nprohibited conduct took place outside of Caltech\u2019s educational programs and\nactivities, if there is any reason to believe that the alleged prohibited\nconduct could contribute to a hostile educational or employment environment,\ninterfere with a student\u2019s access to education, or otherwise compromise the\nsafety of the Caltech community, Caltech will still take prompt action, as\nwarranted and appropriate, to provide for the safety and well-being of the\nindividual reporting and the campus community, including taking reasonable\nsteps to stop and remedy the effects of the prohibited conduct and to prevent\nrecurrence of the behavior. This may include the Title IX Coordinator\u2019s\ninitiating a complaint under these procedures on their own authority. If other\nInstitute policies are implicated, the Title IX Coordinator may also refer the\nmatter to the appropriate office for follow-up so the matter is properly\naddressed.\n\n##  IX. Consolidation of Complaints\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator may consolidate complaints of allegations covered\nunder these procedures against more than one respondent, or by more than one\ncomplainant against one or more respondents, or by one party against the other\nparty, where the allegations arise out of the same facts or circumstances.\n\n##  X. Notice of Allegations\n\nWithin fourteen (14) business days of receiving or initiating a complaint or\nreceiving information about conduct that reasonably may constitute sex\ndiscrimination, whichever is earlier, the Title IX Coordinator must provide\nwritten notice to the parties of the following, with sufficient time for the\nparties\u2014generally fourteen (14) business days\u2014to prepare a response before any\ninitial interview:\n\n  1. allegations, including sufficient details known at the time, including the identities of the parties involved in the incident, if known, the misconduct alleged, and the date and location of the alleged incident, if known;\n  2. alleged institute policy violations under review;\n  3. procedures and requirements of the resolution process(es) that will be offered or used to resolve the allegation(s);\n  4. statement that the parties may have an advisor of their choice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney, accompany them at any stage of the process;\n  5. statement that the parties may review and inspect relevant and permissible evidence under an investigation process or an accurate description of such evidence, provided that either party is entitled to review and inspect such evidence upon request;\n  6. A statement that the respondent is presumed not responsible for the reported misconduct unless and until the evidence supports a different determination\n  7. A statement that determinations of responsibility are made at the conclusion of the process and that the Parties will be given an opportunity during the review and comment period to inspect and review all relevant evidence\n  8. statement that knowingly making false statements or submitting false information is prohibited and may subject the offending party to discipline;\n  9. information regarding appropriate counseling and other support resources developed and maintained by the Institute;\n  10. statement that retaliation is prohibited;\n  11. copies of the policy and pertinent procedures.\n\nThe parties will be provided with written notice of any new allegations that\narise during the course of the investigation that could subject either party\nto new or additional sanctions.\n\n##  XI. Dismissal of a Complaint\n\nUpon receiving a complaint, within fourteen (14) business days, the Title IX\nCoordinator may dismiss the complaint for resolution under these procedures\nfor the following reasons:\n\n  * Caltech is unable to identify the respondent after taking reasonable steps to do so;\n  * The respondent is not participating in Caltech\u2019s education program or activity and is not employed by the recipient;\n  * The complainant voluntarily withdraws any or all of the allegations in the complaint, the Title IX Coordinator declines to initiate a complaint and determines that, without the complainant\u2019s withdrawn allegations, the conduct that remains alleged in the complaint, if any, would not constitute prohibited conduct even if proven; or\n  * The recipient determines the conduct alleged in the complaint, even if proven, would not constitute prohibited conduct. Prior to dismissing the complaint under this paragraph, the Title IX Coordinator will make reasonable efforts to clarify the allegations with the complainant.\n\nUpon dismissal, the Title IX Coordinator will promptly notify the complainant\nof the basis for the dismissal. If the dismissal occurs after the respondent\nhas been notified of the allegations, then the Title IX Coordinator must also\nnotify the respondent of the dismissal and the basis for the dismissal\npromptly following notification to the complainant, or simultaneously if\nnotification is in writing.\n\nThe parties may submit an appeal of any dismissal decision, in writing, to the\nassociate vice president of human resources, within seven (7) business days of\nreceiving the dismissal decision.\n\nThis appeal of a dismissal of a complaint, or of certain allegations therein,\nis limited to one or more of the following grounds: a procedural irregularity\nthat affected the dismissal decision; new evidence (including a new witness)\nthat was not reasonably available at the time of the dismissal decision that\ncould affect that decision; and the Title IX Coordinator, investigator, or\nother decision decisionmaker had a conflict of interest or bias for or against\ncomplainants or respondents generally or the individual complainant or\nrespondent that affected the dismissal decision.\n\nIf a party submits an appeal of a dismissal, the other party will have the\nopportunity to submit a written response to the appeal within ten (10)\ncalendar days of the filing of the appeal. The parties simultaneously will be\ninformed, in writing, of the outcome of the appeal generally within thirty\n(30) business days. The appeal decision letter will state the rationale for\nthe result. Appeal decisions are final.\n\nEven where dismissal of a complaint occurs, the Title IX Coordinator may still\nprovide supportive measures to parties or take other appropriate action in\nresponse to alleged concerns.\n\nA complaint will not be dismissed, and a resolution process will not be\ndiscontinued, merely because it has not concluded before an undergraduate or\ngraduate student has graduated. Caltech may continue the process, even if the\ngraduated student elects not to participate in the process.\n\n##  XII. Resolution Options: Informal Resolutions and Investigation Process\n\nCaltech offers five resolution options to resolve allegations: (1) the\nAdministrative Resolution process, (2) the Remedy-Based Resolution process,\n(3) the Mediation process, (4) Restorative Justice, and (5) the Investigation\nprocess. The Administrative Resolution process, process, the Remedy-Based\nResolution process, the Mediation process and the Restorative Justice process\nare informal resolutions available only at the discretion of the Title IX\nCoordinator under circumstances they deem appropriate and if not in conflict\nwith federal, state, or local law. Depending on their assessment of the\nallegations and circumstances, including the potential of the alleged conduct\npresenting a future risk of harm to others, the Title IX Coordinator may\noffer, but not require or pressure, the parties the option to pursue one or\nmore of the informal resolution options.\n\nUnder all of the resolution options, remedies are designed to restore or\npreserve equal access to Caltech\u2019s education program or activity. Remedies may\ninclude actions that qualify as supportive measures, but unlike supportive\nmeasures, remedies may also include actions that are disciplinary, punitive,\nor burden the other party.\n\nAny person designated by Caltech to serve as a facilitator, investigator or\ndecisionmaker in any of the resolution processes set out below (e.g., Title IX\nCoordinator, investigator, mediator, decisionmaker, administrator who\ndetermines sanctions and remedies, administrator hearing an appeal of an\noutcome of an investigation process) may not have a conflict of interest or\nbias for or against complainants or respondents generally or an individual\ncomplainant or respondent. In addition, the individual facilitating any\ninformal resolution process must not be the same person as the investigator or\nthe decisionmaker in any investigation process, to the extent that process has\nbeen initiated. Parties will be provided an opportunity to object to a person\ncarrying out a facilitation role in the process for the consideration and\ndecision of the Title IX Coordinator on the grounds of a conflict of interest\nor bias. Where an objection is made about the Title IX Coordinator, the\ndecision as to their suitability will be made by the associate vice president\nfor human resources. Any consideration of impartiality, or objections based on\nconflict of interest or bias, of those involved in Title IX processes must be\nreviewed with thoughtful consideration of individual circumstances.\nDetermination of whether a conflict of interest or bias exists in a particular\ninstance will be a matter of judgment involving all the material facts of the\nsituation.\n\nIn addition, any person designated by Caltech to facilitate any of the\nresolution processes set out below (e.g., Title IX Coordinator, investigator,\ndecisionmaker, mediator, administrator who determines sanctions and remedies,\nadministrator hearing an appeal of an outcome of an investigation process)\nwill receive training that is trauma-informed and comprehensive and that\nincludes information appropriate to their respective roles and duties,\nincluding how to serve impartially and properly identify permissible and\nimpermissible evidence.\n\nIn deciding the scope of their participation in resolution processes, parties\nshould consider that statements and evidence provided in the course of a\nresolution process may be produced to law enforcement in compliance with a\nsubpoena or other court order and used in a civil or criminal proceeding.\n\nAt any time following the making of a complaint, including during an\ninvestigation process, prior to reaching a final determination regarding\nresponsibility, inclusive of any appeal process, the Title IX Coordinator may\noffer and initiate an informal resolution process\u2014an Administrative\nResolution, Mediation, a Remedy-Based Resolution, or Restorative Justice\u2014if\ndetermined to be appropriate and not in conflict with Federal, State or local\nlaw, provided that the Title IX Coordinator:\n\n  1. Provides to the parties written notice disclosing the allegations, the requirements, and consequences of the AR, Mediation, RBR, or RJ process, including that: (a) the requirements of the informal resolution process; (b) completing such a resolution process precludes the parties from initiating or resuming a complaint arising from the same allegations; (c) at any time prior to agreeing to a resolution, either party has the right to withdraw from the informal resolution process and initiate or resume the investigation process; (d) potential terms that may be requested or offered in an informal resolution agreement, including notice that agreement is binding only on the parties; and (e) notice of information that will be maintained by Caltech or could be disclosed by Caltech in the investigation process, if subsequently initiated or resumed.  \n\n  2. Obtains the parties\u2019 voluntary written consent to the AR, Mediation, RJ, or RBR process.\n\n###  A. Administrative Resolution\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator, with the voluntary written consent of the parties,\nmay offer the parties an opportunity to engage in the administrative\nresolution (AR) process. The Title IX Coordinator determines whether an AR is\nan appropriate option for resolving the allegations at issue, depending on\ntheir assessment of the allegations and circumstances. The AR option provides\nan opportunity for the respondent to accept responsibility for their alleged\nconduct and proceed to a resolution without a formal investigation.\nComplainants and respondents participating in this process may have an advisor\nof their choice accompany them when engaging in this resolution process, as\nset forth above in Section III.  \n  \nIf the AR option is agreed to by a complainant, the Title IX Coordinator will\nmeet with the respondent to review the allegations.  \n  \nThe Title IX Coordinator will offer the respondent the opportunity to resolve\nthe complaint by AR by accepting responsibility for the alleged conduct. It is\nthe respondent\u2019s option and decision whether to do so. If the respondent\nelects to acknowledge that the alleged conduct occurred and takes\nresponsibility for the alleged conduct, the respondent will sign a written\nacknowledgement, and the matter will be referred to the appropriate\ndecisionmaker for a decision concerning sanctions and remedies that may be\nappropriate.  \n  \nGenerally, for purposes of determining sanctions in connection with an AR, the\ndecisionmaker shall be determined based upon the respondent\u2019s affiliation (the\nvice provost of research or administration for faculty, the associate vice\npresident for human resources for postdoctoral scholars and campus staff, or\nthe deputy director for Human Resources at JPL for JPL employees). In the case\nof student respondents, the appropriate dean will serve as the decisionmaker.  \n  \nIn determining sanctions and remedies, decisionmakers will consult with the\nTitle IX Coordinator and may consult with any other individual they deem\nappropriate.  \n  \nThe parties will both be notified simultaneously in writing of the resolution,\nincluding any sanctions and remedies. Within ten (10) business days of\nreceiving this letter, either party may appeal in writing as outlined below in\nSection D, 11.  \n  \nAn AR process will be concluded within a reasonably prompt time frame after\nthe complaint has been made, generally forty-five (45) business days. The\nTitle IX Coordinator will keep the parties informed of the status of the\nprocess. The Title IX Coordinator may delay the process temporarily or extend\nthe time frame for good cause, providing written notice to the parties of any\ndelays or extensions and the reasons therefor.  \n  \nIf a resolution is not reached under this process within a reasonable amount\nof time, or if the Title IX Coordinator determines that one or both parties\nare not participating in good faith or a timely or appropriate manner in the\nprocess, the Title IX Coordinator may terminate the process, and the\ncomplainant may pursue an investigation or other resolution options determined\nto be appropriate by the Title IX Coordinator.  \n  \nAn AR is the final resolution of the allegations contained therein and is not\nsubject to appeal.\n\n###  B. Remedy-Based Resolution\n\nA Remedy-Based Resolution (RBR) is a mutual non-disciplinary agreement entered\ninto among Caltech and the parties to a complaint. The Title IX Coordinator\ndetermines whether an RBR is an appropriate option for resolving the\nallegations at issue, depending on their assessment of the allegations and\ncircumstances. In a RBR, a respondent agrees to undertake, or all parties\nagree to undertake, certain social, academic, and/or administrative steps, on\na certain timeline, as a means of resolving a complaint of prohibited conduct\nwithout an investigation and a finding regarding responsibility. All parties,\nand the Title IX Coordinator on behalf of Caltech, must voluntarily agree to,\nand sign a written agreement setting out, all the terms of the RBR as the\ncomplete and final resolution of the complaint(s). If an agreement is reached,\nthe complainant cannot subsequently file a complaint for an investigation\nregarding the same alleged conduct, unless a respondent does not fulfill their\nagreed upon commitments under the RBR as determined by the Title IX\nCoordinator. Complainants and respondents participating in this process may\nhave an advisor of their choice accompany them when engaging in this\nresolution process, as set out above in Section III.  \n  \nKey aspects of an RBR include that it:\n\n  * is a voluntary process when available to resolve allegations; unlike an investigation process and requires that all parties agree to engage in the process;\n  * focuses on non-disciplinary remedies to address the concerns underlying the alleged prohibited conduct. For example, under an RBR, a respondent can agree to undertake a counseling and/or education program to address behavioral issues;\n  * provides a measure of control to the complainant in crafting measures and remedies undertaken by the respondent, allowing the complainant to focus on remedying specific social, academic, or administrative concerns;\n  * leaves open to the parties the alternative option of pursuing an investigation at any time during the negotiation process, or if the parties ultimately cannot come to a mutually acceptable agreement or if a party fails to comply with any or all of their commitments under an executed RBR as determined by the Title IX Coordinator;\n  * provides both parties a final resolution of the complaint if an agreement is reached and the parties comply with its terms; and\n  * does not involve an adjudication of the allegations and a potential finding of responsibility against the respondent.\n\nIn cases in which the Title IX Coordinator determines an RBR may be\nappropriate, the Title IX Coordinator will discuss with a complainant,\npotential elements of an RBR pertinent to their concerns and allegations to\nhelp them determine whether an RBR is an option they wish to pursue. If all\nparties to a complaint are agreeable to pursuing a resolution through the RBR\nprocess and provide voluntary written consent to engage in the RBR process,\nthe Title IX Coordinator will work with the parties separately to negotiate\nand craft the agreement. The parties do not engage directly with one another.\nThe Title IX Coordinator may seek the assistance of academic and\nadministrative leadership, as appropriate, to make possible and implement\nelements of the agreement.  \n  \nPotential elements of an RBR agreement include, but are not limited to,\ncounseling or substance abuse treatment for a respondent; training for a\nrespondent provided by the Title IX Coordinator and/or other resources; and\nother supportive measures, as described above in Section VI.  \n  \nAn RBR process culminating in a signed agreement will be concluded within a\nreasonably prompt time frame after the complaint has been made, generally\nforty-five (45) calendar days. The Title IX Coordinator will keep the parties\ninformed of the status of the process. The Title IX Coordinator may delay the\nprocess temporarily or extend the time frame for good cause, providing written\nnotice to the parties of any delays or extensions and the reasons therefor.\nGood cause may include but is not limited to the absence of a party or a\nparty\u2019s advisor; the need for language assistance or accommodation of\ndisabilities; the number of parties; and office closures.  \n  \nIf a resolution is not reached under this process within a reasonable amount\nof time, or if the Title IX Coordinator determines that one or both parties\nare not participating in good faith or a timely or appropriate manner in the\nprocess, the Title IX Coordinator may terminate the process, and the\ncomplainant may pursue an investigation or any other resolution options\ndetermined to be appropriate by the Title IX Coordinator.  \n  \nA Remedy-Based Resolution is the final resolution of the allegations it\naddresses, unless a party fails to carry out their commitments under the\nagreement, as determined by the Title IX Coordinator. An RBR is not subject to\nappeal.\n\n###  C. Mediation\n\nIn appropriate cases, as determined by the Title IX Coordinator, Mediation may\nbe offered as a resolution option to resolve allegations of prohibited\nconduct.\n\nMediation is a voluntary process where a facilitator (mediator) works with the\ncomplainant and respondent and Caltech (represented by the Title IX\nCoordinator) to attempt to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of a\ncomplaint of prohibited conduct (Mediated Resolution). A Mediated Resolution\nwill be reflected in a written agreement signed by the parties and the Title\nIX Coordinator, on behalf of Caltech.\n\nA Mediated Resolution entered into by the parties and Caltech is the final\nresolution of the complaint and the allegations therein (i.e., the complainant\ncannot subsequently file a complaint for an investigation regarding the same\nalleged conduct), unless a party fails to carry out their commitments under\nthe Mediated Resolution Agreement, as determined by the Title IX Coordinator.\n\nA Mediation is different than a Remedy-Based Resolution in that the elements\nof the agreement may include disciplinary sanctions. As with an RBR, there are\nno findings of responsibility in a Mediation process. However, in a Mediation\nprocess, measures that otherwise may be imposed as a sanction as a result of a\nfinding of responsibility may be agreed upon by the parties, including\nCaltech, in the context of a mediated resolution.\n\nIf all parties to a complaint are agreeable to the Mediation process and\nprovide voluntary written consent to engage in the Mediation process, the\nTitle IX Coordinator will assign a mediator who will work with the parties to\nnegotiate and prepare the agreement. The Title IX Coordinator has the\ndiscretion to elect to conduct the mediation or may appoint another\nappropriately trained individual to conduct the mediation. The Title IX\nCoordinator will notify the parties of their right to and process for\nobjecting to the mediator on the basis of conflict of interest or bias.\n\nDuring a Mediation, the parties do not engage directly with one another.\n\nA Mediation process culminating in a signed agreement will be concluded within\na reasonably prompt time frame after the complaint has been made, generally\nsixty (60) calendar days. The Title IX Coordinator will keep the parties\ninformed of the status of the process. The Title IX Coordinator may delay the\nprocess temporarily or extend the time frame for good cause, providing written\nnotice to the parties of any delays or extensions and the reasons therefor.\n\nIf a resolution is not reached under this process within a reasonable amount\nof time, or if the Title IX Coordinator determines that one or more parties\nare not participating in good faith or a timely or appropriate manner in the\nprocess, the Title IX Coordinator may terminate the process, and the\ncomplainant may pursue an investigation or any other resolution options\ndetermined to be appropriate by the Title IX Coordinator.\n\nA Mediation is the final resolution of the allegations it addresses, unless a\nparty fails to carry out their commitments under the agreement, as determined\nby the Title IX Coordinator and is not subject to appeal.\n\n###  D. Restorative Justice\n\nIn appropriate cases, as determined by the Title IX Coordinator, the\nRestoration Justice (RJ) process may be offered as a resolution option to\nresolve an allegation. The RJ process is a voluntary process where a\nfacilitator works with the complainant and respondent to examine the harmful\nimpact of the alleged conduct and examine solutions that can repair the harm\nand/or address accountability.\n\nTo qualify for a RJ, the respondent must acknowledge the harm experienced by\nthe complainant and agree to take responsibility for repairing the harm, to\nthe extent possible, experienced by the complainant, and any other relevant,\ndirectly impacted individuals in the community. Respondent\u2019s acknowledgement\nof harm is not an admission of a Policy violation(s), unless respondent\nexpressly accepted responsibility pursuant to the process outlined in these\nprocedures. As with an RBR and a Mediation, there are no formal findings of\nresponsibility in the RJ process. If appropriate under the circumstances, as\ndetermined by the Title IX Coordinator, affected community members may also\nparticipate in the RJ process.\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator has the discretion to conduct the RJ process or may\nappoint another appropriately trained individual to conduct the process. The\nTitle IX Coordinator will notify the parties of their right to and process for\nobjecting to the facilitator on the basis of conflict of interest or bias.\n\nIf a resolution is not reached under this process within a reasonable time, or\nif the Title IX Coordinator determines that one or more parties are not\nparticipating in good faith or a timely or appropriate manner in the process,\nthe Title IX Coordinator may terminate the process, and the complainant may\npursue an investigation or any other resolution options determined to be\nappropriate by the Title IX Coordinator.\n\nA RJ resolution is the final resolution of the allegation(s) it addresses and\nis not subject to appeal.\n\n###  E. Investigation Process\n\n####  1.0 Introduction\n\nThe Investigation Process provides both parties with a prompt and equitable\nresolution of the allegations. The investigation and adjudication of alleged\nprohibited conduct under this Section is not an adversarial process between\nthe complainant, the respondent, and the witnesses, but rather a process by\nwhich Caltech complies with its obligations under existing law. The\ncomplainant does not have the burden to prove, nor does the respondent have\nthe burden to disprove, the allegations of prohibited conduct. It is Caltech\u2019s\nresponsibility to gather sufficient evidence to make a determination whether\nthe alleged prohibited conduct occurred. If the decisionmaker determines that\na preponderance of the evidence substantiates alleged prohibited conduct and a\nviolation of the Sex Discrimination Policy, sanctions, remedies, or systemic\nremedies, as appropriate, will be imposed. The decisions made by the\ndecisionmaker, subject to the resolution of any appeal, represent the final\nresolution of the complaint, whether or not a respondent is found responsible.\n\nCaltech\u2019s investigation will occur independently from any legal/criminal\nproceedings that may take place.\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator will assign an appropriate investigator to carry out\nthe investigation. The investigator will also serve as the decisionmaker for\npurposes of making findings of disputed facts and determining whether a\nviolation(s) of the Policy occurred unless another decisionmaker is appointed\nby the Title IX Coordinator.\n\nAll participants in an investigation will receive a fair and impartial process\nand be treated with dignity, care, and respect. Caltech\u2019s policy and\ninvestigation procedures are intended to ensure that individuals reported for\nprohibited conduct are not prejudged and are provided with adequate notice and\nan opportunity to be heard regarding the allegations made against them.\nRespondents are presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct until a\ndetermination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the\ninvestigation process.\n\nThe purpose of the investigation is to gather the evidence relating to the\ncomplaint, and decisions are based on an objective evaluation of all relevant\nevidence, including both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence. Evidence may\ninclude statements from the parties and witnesses; documents relating to the\ncomplaint, such as texts, photographs, and emails; and physical evidence, such\nas clothing, rape kit evidence, and weapons.\n\nCredibility determinations may not be based on a person\u2019s status as a\ncomplainant, respondent, or witness.\n\nThe investigation will be trauma-informed and impartial. Those involved in\nquestioning parties and witnesses\u2014namely, the Title IX Coordinator and Title\nIX deputies, the investigator and the decisionmaker\u2014will receive training in\nconducting fair and trauma-informed investigations and hearings.\n\nThe investigation will be treated as private to the extent reasonable. Caltech\ndoes not restrict the ability of the parties to prepare for or participate in\nthe investigation. Caltech administrators will be informed on a need-to-know\nbasis. During the pendency of the investigation, Caltech will take reasonable\nand appropriate efforts to preserve the privacy of the parties and witnesses\nand protect the confidentiality of information. With the exception of the\nhearing portion, if any, of the investigation process, as set out in the live\nhearing procedures, no meetings or conversations that take place as part of\nthe investigation process may be recorded by anyone. Investigation files,\nincluding the recording of any hearing, will be maintained by the Equity and\nTitle IX Office.\n\nCaltech does not tolerate retaliation and will take steps to prevent\nretaliation and strong responsive action if it occurs. All participants,\nincluding complainants, respondents, and witnesses, are protected against\nretaliation, and will be advised to notify Caltech immediately if retaliation\noccurs.\n\nAny new allegations that arise during the course of the investigation that\ncould subject either party to new or additional sanctions shall be subject to\nthe notice requirements set out above in Sections V (Initial Title IX\nAssessment) and XI (Notice of Allegations).\n\nParties and witnesses who elect to participate in the investigation process\nare expected to do so in good faith and in a timely, reasonable, and\nappropriate manner. If the Title IX Coordinator determines that an individual\nis not complying with this expectation (e.g., failing to schedule meetings\nwith the investigator, not showing up to meetings, neglecting to provide\nevidence they said they would provide, failing to respond to the draft\ninvestigation report), the Title IX Coordinator may conclude the investigation\nphase without further opportunity by such individual to provide evidence.\n\n####  2.0 Impermissible Evidence and Limitations on Questioning\n\nThe investigator and decisionmaker will not ask parties or witnesses nor\npermit questions that are repetitive, irrelevant, or harassing. The following\ntypes of evidence must be excluded from consideration, and questions seeking\nsuch evidence are impermissible unless an exception applies. The investigator\nand the decisionmaker will not consider, ask questions, or seek evidence:\n\n  * that is protected under a privilege as recognized by Federal or State law or evidence provided to a confidential employee, unless the person to whom the privilege or confidentiality is owed has voluntarily waived the privilege or confidentiality;\n  * of a party\u2019s or witness\u2019s records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional in connection with the provision of treatment to the party or witness, unless the party or witness provides their voluntary, written consent for use in the investigation process;\n  * that relates to a complainant\u2019s sexual interests or prior or subsequent sexual conduct with anyone, except to the extent such questions and/or evidence are offered or used to determine (1) whether someone other than the respondent committed the conduct alleged by the complainant or (2) whether prior sexual conduct between complainant and respondent prove consent to the alleged sex-based harassment.\n\nThe fact of prior consensual sexual, romantic, or intimate relationship\nbetween the complainant and respondent does not by itself imply consent or\npreclude a finding of prohibited conduct. The investigator and decisionmaker\nshall not consider the existence of a dating relationship or prior or\nsubsequent consensual sexual relations between the parties unless the evidence\nis relevant to how the parties communicated consent in prior or subsequent\nconsensual sexual relations. Where the investigator or decisionmaker allow\nconsideration of evidence about a dating relationship or prior or subsequent\nconsensual sexual relations between the parties, the mere fact that the\nparties engaged in other consensual sexual relations with one another is never\nsufficient, by itself, to establish that the conduct in question was\nconsensual. Before allowing the consideration of any evidence described in\nthis section, the investigator or decisionmaker shall provide a written\nexplanation to the parties as to why consideration of the evidence meets the\nrequirements for consideration.\n\n####  3.0 Amnesty Concerning Policy Violations: Complainants and Witnesses\n\nThe investigator will investigate any allegations that alcohol or drugs were\ninvolved in the incident.\n\nA student who participates as a complainant or witness in an investigation of\nsexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking will not be\nsubject to disciplinary sanctions for a violation of Caltech\u2019s student conduct\npolicies at or near the time of the incident, including but not limited to the\nSubstance Abuse Policy, unless Caltech determines that the violation was\negregious, including but not limited to, an action that places the health or\nsafety of any other person at risk or involves conduct that violates Caltech\u2019s\npolicies prohibiting discrimination, or other serious misconduct like\nplagiarism, cheating, research misconduct, or other forms of academic\ndishonesty.\n\nWhether a student\u2019s violation of the Student Health and Hygiene Policies and\nother Caltech health and safety measures warrants amnesty will be determined\non a case-by-case basis by the Title IX Coordinator. However, absent conduct\nshowing a deliberate and reckless disregard for the health of others - for\nexample, by hiding one\u2019s own known infected status and exposing others \u2013 a\nstudent who participates as a complainant or witness in an investigation of\nsexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking will not be\nsubject to disciplinary sanctions for a violation of such policies and\nmeasures.\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator, in consultation with the Director, Employee and\nOrganizational Development, has the discretion to grant amnesty for certain\npolicy violations to employees who participates as a complainant or witness in\nan investigation of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or\nstalking\n\n####  4.0 Standard of Evidence\n\nAll decisions made in the course of this investigation process will utilize\nthe preponderance of evidence standard. A preponderance of evidence means that\nit is more likely than not that the alleged prohibited conduct occurred.\nStated another way, it means that the likelihood the alleged prohibited\nconduct occurred is any amount over 50%. The decisionmaker will make a\ndecision on the disputed facts and also decide whether the evidence makes it\nmore likely than not that the alleged prohibited conduct occurred based on the\nevidence available at the time of the decision. When the decisionmaker is\npresented with two different but plausible versions of alleged prohibited\nconduct, credibility determinations may affect the outcome.\n\n####  5.0 Appointment of Decisionmaker\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator shall have the discretion to determine which\nappropriately trained individual will serve as the decisionmaker in the\ninvestigation process. The decisionmaker may be the same person as the\ninvestigator. As set forth below, the decisionmaker conducts the process for\ndetermining credibility through either individual party and witness meetings\nwith the decisionmaker or a live hearing. The parties will be notified of the\nidentity of the decisionmaker before the hearing as well as the process for\nobjecting to the identity of the decisionmaker on the basis of a conflict of\ninterest or bias.\n\n####  6.0 Timeline\n\nComplaints will be evaluated, investigated, and resolved, including any\nappeals, within a reasonably prompt time frame after the complaint has been\nmade, generally one hundred and twenty (120) business days.\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator will provide the parties written updates of the\nstatus of the investigation every thirty (30) days, including the date by\nwhich the parties shall be notified of the outcome of the investigation and\nthe deadlines and process for parties to appeal. The Title IX Coordinator may\ndelay the investigation process temporarily or extend the time frame for good\ncause, providing prompt written notice to the parties of any delays or\nextensions and the reasons therefor.\n\nGood cause may include but is not limited to the absence of a party, a party\u2019s\nadvisor, or a witness; concurrent law enforcement activity; the need for\nlanguage assistance or accommodation of disabilities; the breadth and scope of\nthe allegations, in terms of content and date, the number of potential\nwitnesses, and the amount of available, relevant evidence; school and office\nclosures, and the need to conduct a thorough, fair and accurate investigation.\nThe Title IX Coordinator shall not unreasonably deny a party\u2019s request for an\nextension of a deadline related to a complaint during periods of examinations\nor school closures.\n\n####  7.0 Procedural Steps for Investigation\n\n#####  7.1 Initial Notification to Parties\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator initiates the investigation process with a written\nnotification sent to both parties. The initial notification will include:\n\n  * A summary of all allegations;\n  * The identity of the involved Parties (if known);\n  * The precise misconduct being alleged;\n  * The date and location of the alleged incident(s) (if known);\n  * The specific policies/offenses implicated;\n  * A statement that retaliation is prohibited;\n  * A description of, link to, or copy of the applicable policy and procedures;\n  * A statement that the parties are entitled to an equal opportunity to access the relevant and not otherwise impermissible evidence;\n  * The name(s) of the Investigator, the decisionmaker (if different than the investigator), and the Title IX Coordinator and notice to parties of their right to and process for objecting to either of the investigator or to the Title IX Coordinator on the basis of conflict of interest or bias;\n  * A statement that the respondent is presumed not responsible for the reported misconduct unless and until the evidence supports a different determination;\n  * A statement that determinations of responsibility are made at the conclusion of the process and that the Parties will be given an opportunity during the review and comment period to inspect and review all relevant evidence;\n  * A statement that retaliation is prohibited;\n  * Information about the confidentiality of the process, including that the parties and their advisors (if applicable) may not share Caltech work product obtained through the investigation resolution process;\n  * A statement that the parties may have an advisor of their choice who may accompany them through all steps of the investigation resolution process.\n  * A statement informing the Parties that Caltech\u2019s Policy prohibits knowingly making false statements, including knowingly submitting false information during the process;\n  * Information about how a party may request disability accommodations\n  * during the investigation resolution process;\n  * Instructions to preserve any evidence that is directly related to the allegations;\n  * The estimated date by which the parties will be notified of the outcome of any investigation.\n\n#####  7.2 Party Advisor\n\nThe complainant and respondent may have an advisor of their choice, in\naccordance with and subject to the requirements set out above in Section III\nof these procedures and the Advisor Policy.\n\n#####  7.3 Conflict of Interest Objections\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator or associate vice president of human resources, as\nappropriate, will consider any objections by the parties on the basis of\nconflict of interest or bias and determine the Title IX Coordinator,\ninvestigator, and decisionmaker for the process, as appropriate.\n\n#####  7.4 Parties\u2019 Participation in the Investigation Process\n\nAfter a reasonable amount of time to review the notice of allegations and\napplicable policies and procedures, the parties will be given equal\nopportunity to meet with the investigator. In those meetings, the investigator\nwill seek and gather evidence about the allegations, including any documents\nor physical evidence, as well as the identification and location of any\nwitnesses. The parties may submit written statements and evidence to the\ninvestigator that document their experiences. Each party is free to choose to\nmeet or not to meet with the investigator, or otherwise to participate or not\nto participate in the investigation process. Regardless of the scope of a\nparty\u2019s participation, the party would still be treated as a party with all\nassociated rights.  \n  \nIn deciding the scope of their participation, parties should consider that\nstatements and evidence provided in the course of an investigation may be\nproduced to law enforcement in compliance with a subpoena or other court order\nand used against them in a civil or criminal proceeding.\n\n#####  7.5 Opportunity to Present Evidence\n\nThroughout the investigation process, the parties may offer witnesses,\ndocuments, and other evidence to the investigator as well as questions for the\ninvestigator to ask the other party and any witnesses. The investigator will\ndetermine whether the parties\u2019 suggested questions are relevant and\npermissible. Caltech does not permit the parties to present expert witnesses\u2019\nwritten or oral reports; however, the investigator or other decisionmaker may\nengage an expert witness to present written or oral reports by expert\nwitnesses if they determine it appropriate.  \n  \nThe parties must not engage in coercion, pressure, undue influence, or\nretaliation with respect to potential witnesses or other parties in the course\nof identifying evidence for the investigator. The parties may seek guidance\nfrom the Title IX Coordinator and the investigator to avoid these concerns.\nCommunications between parties and witnesses deemed to have resulted from\ncoercion, pressure, undue influence, or retaliation may be discounted\naltogether by the decisionmaker or may be considered by the decisionmaker in\nmaking credibility determinations and weighing evidence deemed subject to the\nundue influence.\n\n#####  7.6 Witness Interviews and Evidence Gathering\n\nThe investigator will interview relevant witnesses and gather other evidence\nrelated to the allegations, if any. Witnesses may submit documents or written\nstatements to the investigator. Written transcripts of the interviews will be\nprepared and will  \nbe made accessible to the parties.\n\n#####  7.7 Confidential Materials\n\nAny evidence reports, including the party and witness interview transcripts\nand appendices of evidence and the hearing transcript, which will be shared\nwith the parties are considered Confidential Materials by Caltech and any\ninappropriate copying, printing, emailing, photographing, downloading, or\nposting on social media of such materials may subject the disclosing party to\ndisciplinary action for violation of Caltech policy protecting confidentiality\nor other Caltech policies, including Caltech\u2019s Honor Code, and, further could\nsubject the disclosing party, to an allegation by a party of retaliation or\nharassment. It is permissible for a party to share the Confidential Materials\nwith attorneys for the purpose of seeking legal advice or with any non-\nattorney advisor they have in the process, and it is permissible to share the\ncontents of the materials with others to obtain informational or emotional\nsupport from family, therapists, or others to exercise any rights under the\ninvestigation process, including writing a response to the draft investigation\nreport or preparing for the hearing.\n\n#####  7.8 Investigation Evidence Record\n\nThe parties will be provided access to all relevant evidence gathered by the\ninvestigator. The parties will have at least ten (10) calendar days to submit\na written response to the evidence. The investigator will determine whether\nthe parties\u2019 responses require any follow-up investigatory action or an\nopportunity for the other party to respond.\n\n#####  7.9 Decision of Process for Determining Credibility\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator has the sole discretion to determine whether the\nprocess for determining credibility will be conducted through individual party\nand witness meetings with the decisionmaker or a live hearing. The Title IX\nCoordinator\u2019s decision will be based on their determination concerning which\nmethod will better promote the prompt, equitable and efficient resolution of\nthe investigation and they may consider any factors or circumstances they\ndetermine are relevant to making this decision, including whether there are\nmultiple parties and the number of witnesses, and the availability of\nparticipants. The Title IX Coordinator will notify the parties concerning\ntheir decision as to which process for determining credibility will be used.\nThe decision concerning which process will be used is not subject to appeal.\n\n#####  7.10 Process for Determining Credibility\n\nThe investigator or other decisionmaker (decisionmaker) shall conduct a\nprocess that enables the decisionmaker to question parties and witnesses to\nadequately assess a party\u2019s or witness\u2019s credibility to the extent credibility\nis both in dispute and relevant to evaluating one or more allegations of\nprohibited conduct. This process may be conducted during individual meetings\nwith the parties and witnesses or during a live hearing. Whether the process\nis followed during an individual meeting or a live hearing will be determined\nby the Title IX Coordinator at their sole discretion based on their assessment\nof which method will better promote the prompt, equitable and efficient\nresolution of the investigation.  \n  \nIf the Title IX Coordinator determines that process will be conducted through\nindividual meetings, the process for proposing and asking relevant and not\notherwise impermissible questions and follow-up questions of parties and\nwitnesses, including questions challenging credibility, will (a) allow the\ndecisionmaker to ask such questions during individual meetings with a party or\nwitness; (b) allow each party to propose questions that the party wants asked\nof any party or witness and have those questions asked by the decisionmaker\nduring one or more individual meetings, including follow-up meetings, with a\nparty or witness; (c) provide each party with written transcript with enough\ntime for the party to have a reasonable opportunity to propose follow-up\nquestions.  \n  \nIf the Title IX Coordinator determines that process will be conducted through\na live hearing, the process for proposing and asking relevant and not\notherwise impermissible questions and follow-up questions of parties and\nwitnesses, including questions challenging credibility, must (a) allow the\ndecisionmaker to ask such questions, and: (b) allow each party to propose such\nquestions that the party wants asked of any party or witness and have those\nquestions asked by the decisionmaker, Questioning may never be conducted by a\nparty personally.\n\n#####  7.11 Evidence/Report Review by Parties\n\nRegardless of the process utilized for determining credibility, prior to the\nprocess being conducted the parties will be provided with a reasonable\nopportunity to review and respond to the evidence and any investigative report\nsummarizing the evidence. After the process for determining credibility is\ncompleted, the investigator will incorporate any new, relevant evidence and\ninformation obtained through the parties\u2019 review into the record.\n\n#####  7.12 Availability of Evidence\n\nAll of the evidence that was made available as provided above will be made\navailable during the individual meetings with the parties or the live hearing\nso that the parties will have equal opportunity to refer to such evidence\nduring the individual meetings or hearing.\n\n#####  7.13 Notification of Decisionmaker\u2019s Identity\n\nPrior to any decisionmaker led meetings or live hearing to access credibility,\nthe parties will be notified of the identity of the decisionmaker if the\ndecisionmaker is someone other than the investigator and they will be given an\nopportunity to object to that individual on the basis of a conflict of\ninterest or bias.\n\n#####  7.14 Parties\u2019 Voluntary Participation in Individual Meeting or Hearing\nProcess\n\nCaltech cannot compel either party, or any witness, to meet with the\ndecisionmaker at the hearing, or to answer questions whether posed by the\ndecisionmaker or a party. Regardless of the scope of a party\u2019s participation\nin the hearing, the party would still be treated as a party with all\nassociated rights. The decisionmaker will not draw an inference about\nresponsibility or credibility based solely on a party\u2019s or witness\u2019s absence\nfrom the individual meetings or hearing or refusal to answer questions from\nthe decisionmaker.  \n  \nThe decisionmaker may re-evaluate the relevance of any question a party or\nwitness refuses to answer after the individual meetings or hearing has\nconcluded.  \n  \nIn deciding the scope of their participation in the individual meetings or\nhearing, individuals should consider that statements and evidence provided in\nthe course of an investigation may be produced to law enforcement in\ncompliance with a subpoena or other court order and used in a civil or\ncriminal proceeding.\n\n#####  7.15 Notification of Decisionmaker\u2019s Identity\n\nPrior to any hearing, or decisionmaker led meetings as described below, the\nParties will be notified of the identity of the decisionmaker and will be\ngiven an opportunity to object to that individual on the basis of a conflict\nof interest or bias.\n\n#####  7.16 Decisionmaker Led Meetings to Assess Credibility\n\nIf the Title IX Coordinator determines that individual meetings with the\ndecisionmaker will be utilized as the process for making credibility\ndeterminations, the investigator or other decisionmaker (decisionmaker) will\nconduct questioning of the parties and any witnesses in individual meeting. To\nthe extent credibility is in dispute and relevant to one or more of the\nallegations, the investigator\u2019s questions may also explore credibility.  \n  \nPrior to conducting interviews (meetings) with the parties and witnesses, the\ndecisionmaker will also ask each of the parties to provide a proposed list of\nquestions to ask the other parties and any witnesses. To the extent\ncredibility is in dispute and relevant to one or more of the allegations,\nquestions proposed by the Parties may also explore credibility. In individual\nmeetings with the Parties and any witnesses, the decisionmaker will ask the\nParties and witnesses the party-proposed questions that the decisionmaker has\ndetermined are relevant and permissible. These meetings will be recorded or\ntranscribed.  \n  \nTypically, within three (3) business days of the conclusion of the first round\nof meetings, the transcripts of the meetings will be provided to the Parties\nfor their review. The parties will then have five (5) business days to review\nthese recordings or transcripts and propose follow-up questions to be asked by\nthe decisionmaker. The decisionmaker will review the proposed questions to\ndetermine relevance and permissibility. If deemed relevant, permissible and\nnonduplicative, the decisionmaker will then meet individually with parties or\nwitnesses and ask the follow-up questions. These follow-up meetings will also\nbe recorded, and the parties will receive the transcripts of these meetings.\nThis final round of questioning is the last such round permitted, unless leave\nis granted to extend, by the decisionmaker.\n\n#####  7.17 Live Hearing Procedures\n\nIf the Title IX Coordinator determines that a live hearing will be utilized as\nthe process for making credibility determinations, the parties will be\nphysically present in separate locations, with technology enabling the\ndecisionmaker and the parties to virtually observe each other\u2019s meeting, and\nany witness meetings, with the decisionmaker while maintaining their physical\nseparation. Parties or witnesses may request to appear by video from a remote\nlocation. Any requests for disability accommodation should be made to the\nTitle IX Coordinator and Caltech\u2019s Accessibility Services Specialist. Only the\ndecisionmaker, the parties and their advisors, witnesses, the investigator,\nappropriate administrators, and others determined by Caltech to be necessary\nto the hearing may attend. The decisionmaker will determine an appropriate and\nreasonable scope and time frame for the hearing, as well as logistical\nprocesses for the hearing, such as for making objections and submitting\nquestions.  \n  \nCaltech will create an audio or audiovisual recording or transcript of any\nlive hearing and make it available to the parties for inspection and review.\nNo party, advisor, or witness is permitted to make independent recordings of\nthe hearing or any other meeting or conversation that takes place under the\ninvestigation process.\n\n#####  7.18 Hearing Process for Proposing and Asking Party Questions\n\nBefore and during any hearing, the parties may submit written questions for\nthe investigator or other decisionmaker to ask the other party and any\nwitnesses with whom the decisionmaker is meeting. The parties can submit\nwritten questions during the hearing through the appropriate technology while\nmaintaining their physical separation. The decisionmaker will facilitate the\nquestioning. The decisionmaker will have the discretion to exclude any\nquestion(s) that they determine inappropriate. At the hearing, the other party\nshall have the opportunity to note an objection in writing to a question\nposed. Neither the decisionmaker nor Caltech is obligated to respond to the\nobjection but may consider it and must include it in the record. The\ndecisionmaker shall have the authority and obligation to discard or rephrase\nany question that the decisionmaker deems to be repetitive, irrelevant or\nharassing. In making these determinations, the decisionmaker is not bound by\nbut may take guidance from formal rules of evidence.\n\n#####  7.19 Decisionmaker Findings\n\nThe decisionmaker will resolve the disputed facts, make credibility\ndeterminations, and decide whether the allegations and any policy violations\nare substantiated by a preponderance of the evidence. In making these\ndecisions, the decisionmaker will consider the relevant and otherwise\npermissible evidence, including the transcripts or recording from the\nindividual meetings or live hearing, the parties\u2019 responses to the evidence,\nand any other evidence gathered by the investigator, The decisionmaker is\nresponsible for resolving disputed facts, making credibility assessments of\nthose interviewed at the hearing, as appropriate and for making determinations\nregarding whether policy violations occurred. The potential conclusions the\ndecisionmaker can reach include but are not limited to a violation of\nCaltech\u2019s Sex Discrimination Policy occurred; inappropriate behavior but no\nviolation occurred; the complaint was not supported by the evidence; the\ncomplaint was brought without a reasonable, good-faith basis.  \n  \nAfter making these decisions, the decisionmaker will meet with the appropriate\nadministrator who will determine any sanctions, remedies, and systemic\nremedies, in order to brief them on the process and factual findings and\nconclusions.

The letter will include:\n\n  * a description of the allegations;\n  * a description of the procedural steps taken from the receipt of the complaint through the determination of responsibility, including any notifications to the parties, interviews with parties and witnesses, site visits, methods used to gather other evidence, and hearings held;\n  * findings of fact supporting the determination;\n  * conclusions regarding the application of the Sex Discrimination Policy and any other applicable Caltech policy to the facts;\n  * a statement, and rationale for, the result as to each allegation, including a determination regarding responsibility and any sanctions, remedies, and systemic remedies determined by the appropriate administrator; and\n  * procedures and permissible bases for the complainant andrespondent to appeal.\n\n#####  7.20 Effective Date of Final Determinations\n\nThe determinations regarding responsibility and sanctions, remedies, and\nsystemic remedies become final either on the date that the parties are\nprovided the result of any appeal, or if an appeal is not filed, the date on\nwhich an appeal would no longer be considered timely.\n\n#####  7.21 Notifying Title IX Coordinator of Investigation Outcome\n\nThe Title IX Coordinator will be informed of the outcome of the investigation\nand any appeal in order to carry out their responsibilities to consult on and\ncoordinate implementation of any sanctions, remedies, and systemic remedies,\nmonitor outcomes, identify and address areas of needed education and training\npresented by the case, and assess and address effects on the campus climate.\n\n#####  7.22 Exceptions\n\nExceptions to or modification of these procedures can be made at any time by\nthe Title IX Coordinator, provost, deans or associate deans, associate vice\npresident for human resources, or director for human resources at JPL in order\nto ensure these procedures promote fairness to both parties and compliance\nwith the law.\n\n####  8.0 Potential Sanctions, Remedies, and Systemic Remedies\n\nIf a violation of Caltech\u2019s Sex Discrimination Policy has occurred,\nappropriate sanctions, remedies, and systemic remedies, as appropriate, will\nbe imposed.\n\nAt the conclusion of the investigation process, if there is a finding of\nresponsibility, the appropriate administrator will determine the appropriate\nsanctions, remedies, and systemic remedies.\n\nGenerally, the appropriate administrator shall be determined based upon the\nrespondent\u2019s affiliation (the vice provost for research or administration for\nfaculty, the associate vice president for human resources for postdoctoral\nscholars and campus staff, the deputy director for human resources at JPL for\nJPL employees, and the appropriate dean for student respondents).\n\nIn determining sanctions, remedies, and systemic remedies, these\nadministrators will consult with the Title IX Coordinator and may consult with\nany other individual they deem appropriate. The appropriate administrator may\nimpose any one or more of the following:\n\n#####  8.1 Sanctions\n\n  * Verbal warning;\n  * Training;\n  * Mandatory coaching;\n  * Mandatory substance abuse treatment;\n  * A formal written warning placed in the respondent\u2019s file;\n  * Exclusion from participation in certain activities for a specified period of time;\n  * Temporary or permanent exclusion from campus;\n  * Suspension of the right to accept new graduate students or postdoctoral scholars;\n  * Transfer of advisees;\n  * Removal from positions of administrative responsibility;\n  * Suspension from positions requiring supervision or interaction with students or other members of the Caltech community;\n  * Restricted access to Caltech premises;\n  * Restricted access to Caltech\u2019s educational programs or activities;\n  * Removal from Caltech housing;\n  * Removal from a supervisory position;\n  * Involuntary leave of absence/suspension;\n  * Disciplinary probation;\n  * Expulsion;\n  * Termination of employment;\n  * Permanent separation from the Institute;\n  * Revocation of admission;\n  * Delay or revocation of degree.\n\n#####  8.2 Remedies\n\n  * Access to counseling services and assistance in setting up initial appointment, both on and off campus;\n  * Imposition of \u201cNo-Contact Letter;\u201d where a no-contact directive is issued after a finding of responsibility has been made, it shall be unilateral and apply only against the party found responsible;\n  * Rescheduling of exams and assignments, and reassignment of grading or other evaluative responsibilities (in conjunction with appropriate faculty and deans as necessary);\n  * Providing alternative course completion options (with the agreement of the appropriate faculty);\n  * Change in class schedule, including the ability to take an \u201cincomplete,\u201d drop a course without penalty, or transfer sections (with the agreement of the appropriate faculty);\n  * Change in work schedule or job assignment;\n  * Change in on-campus housing, when feasible;\n  * Arranging to dissolve a housing contract and prorating a refund in accordance with campus housing policies;\n  * Assistance from Caltech support staff in completing housing relocation;\n  * Limiting an individual or organization\u2019s access to certain Caltech facilities or activities pending resolution of the matter;\n  * Voluntary leave of absence;\n  * Providing an escort to ensure safe movement between classes and activities;\n  * Providing medical services;\n  * Providing academic support services, such as tutoring;\n  * Any other remedy that can be tailored to the involved individuals to reasonably achieve the goals of this policy.\n\n#####  8.3 Systemic Remedies\n\n  * Institute-wide, division-wide, and/or option-wide, or other team-based communication or outreach effort and training, as appropriate;\n  * Addition of information to Equity and Title IX Office website, or other Institute website, as appropriate;\n  * Conduct of appropriate climate survey to gather information pertinent to preventative outreach efforts.\n\nIf the respondent was found not to have violated Caltech\u2019s Sex Discrimination\nPolicy, but the investigation concluded that they committed some other\nwrongful or improper act, appropriate corrective action will be taken.\nEffective corrective action may also require remedies for a complainant and/or\nsystemic remedies for the broader Caltech community. Caltech will take\nappropriate measures to prevent the reoccurrence of any prohibited conduct,\nand to correct and prevent any discriminatory or retaliatory effects, as\nappropriate.\n\nIn determining sanctions, remedies, and systemic remedies, as appropriate, the\nadministrator will consult with the Title IX Coordinator and other persons\nthey deem appropriate, to enable Caltech to take steps to prevent recurrence\nof any harassment and to correct its discriminatory effects on the complainant\nand, if appropriate, others.\n\nThe Institute may undertake remedies and systemic remedies, as appropriate, to\nsafeguard a complainant\u2019s access to education, at any time.

Moreover, Caltech shall consider and respond to requests for\naccommodations relating to prior incidents of sexual harassment that could\ncontribute to a hostile educational environment or otherwise interfere with a\nstudent\u2019s access to education or an employee\u2019s employment where both\nindividuals are, at the time of the request, subject to Caltech\u2019s policies.\n\n####  9.0 Disclosure of Outcomes\n\nOutcomes of disciplinary proceedings may be disclosed consistent with\napplicable law, including FERPA, Title IX, and the Clery Act. Upon request,\nCaltech will disclose the outcomes of a disciplinary proceeding against a\nstudent who is the alleged perpetrator of any crime of sexual violence to the\nalleged victim.\n\nOutcomes of the investigation process will be disclosed on a need-to-know\nbasis, as determined by the Title IX Coordinator, in order to effect sanctions\nand/or other remedies and systemic remedies.\n\n##  XIII. Appeals\n\nAppeals may be submitted by either party. They must be in writing and\nsubmitted within ten (10) calendar days of notification of the decision to the\nappropriate administrator (the provost for faculty, the associate vice\npresident for human resources for postdoctoral scholars and campus staff, the\nvice president of student affairs for students, or the director for human\nresources at JPL for JPL employee respondents). In assessing appeals, these\nadministrators may consult with any individual they deem appropriate. The\nrecipient of the appeal will notify the Title IX Coordinator and any other\nparty in writing when an appeal is filed.\n\nAppeals of decisions resulting from the investigation process are limited to\none or more of the following grounds: (a) a procedural irregularity that\naffected the outcome of the matter; (b) new evidence (including a new witness)\nthat was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding\nresponsibility was made and that could affect the outcome of the matter; and\n(c) the Title IX Coordinator, investigator, decisionmaker(s), or administrator\nwho determined and imposed any sanctions or remedies had a conflict of\ninterest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or the\nindividual complainant or respondent that  \naffected the outcome of the matter; (d) the sanctions or remedies are\nsubstantially disproportionate to the conduct for which the respondent was\nfound responsible.\n\nIf a party submits an appeal, the other party will have the opportunity to\nsubmit a written response to the appeal within ten (10) calendar days of the\nfiling of the appeal. Appeals will be decided within a reasonable period of\ntime after the last day for a party to file a response to an appeal and\nnormally within thirty (30) calendar days. The parties simultaneously will be\ninformed, in writing, of the outcome of the appeal. The appeal decision letter\nwill state the rationale for the result. Appeal decisions are final.\n\nIf the appeal is granted in whole or in part, the administrator deciding the\nappeal will inform the Title IX Coordinator, the decisionmaker, and/or other\nappropriate Caltech administrator(s) so that appropriate follow up action can\nbe taken to implement the appeal decision.\n\nIf the appeal is granted based on ground (d), the appeal administrator will\ndetermine what sanctions or remedies are appropriate if any, and their\ndecision is final.\n\n##  XIV. Further Complaints\n\nIf the corrective action does not end the prohibited conduct, the complainant\nshould immediately notify at campus the Title IX Coordinator, or a deputy\nTitle IX Coordinator, the provost or a division chair, dean or associate dean,\nEmployee and Organizational Development director; or at JPL, the Deputy Title\nIX Coordinator. In such cases, the complainant has the right to file another\ncomplaint based on new prohibited conduct.\n\n###  Related Policies and Procedures\n\n  * [Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2925/caltech_institute_policy-sex_and_gender_based_misconduct.pdf)\n  * [Nondiscrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2647/caltech_institute_policy-nondiscrmination_and_equal_opportunity_employment.pdf)\n  * [Unlawful Harassment and Abusive Contact Policy](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2641/caltech_institute_policy-unlawful_harassment.pdf)\n  * [Procedures for Complaints of Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2704/caltech_institute_procedure-complaints_of_unlawful_discrimination_harassment_and_retaliation.pdf)\n  * [Violence Prevention Policy](https://hr70.divisions.caltech.edu/documents/2924/caltech_institute_policy-violence_prevention.pdf)\n\n##  XV.

        "content": "##  1.0 Policy\n\nCaltech is committed to providing a safe, healthy, and productive work and\nacademic environment for all members of the Caltech community. Consistent with\nthe Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities\nAct Amendments of 1989, it is Caltech\u2019s policy to maintain a work and academic\nenvironment free from drug and alcohol abuse. Faculty, staff, postdoctoral\nscholars, students, visitors, volunteers, and contractors performing work on\nCaltech\u2019s premises, including at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (\u201cJPL\u201d), are\nrequired to comply with this policy.\n\n##  2.0 Scope\n\n###  2.1 Prohibited Conduct\n\nThe unlawful use, manufacture, distribution, cultivation, dispensation,\npossession, sale, purchase of, or offer to sell or purchase controlled\nsubstances or alcohol on the Caltech campus or its off-site locations,\nincluding JPL, or as any part of its activities, is prohibited. Controlled\nsubstances include, but are not limited to, amphetamines, cocaine, marijuana,\nopiates, phencyclidine (PCP) and their metabolites. **Despite recent changes\nto California law, marijuana still is a controlled substance under federal\nlaw, and therefore the use, manufacture, distribution, cultivation,\ndispensation, possession, sale, purchase of or offer to sell or purchase\nmarijuana on the Caltech campus or its off-site locations, including JPL, or\nas any part of its activities, continues to be prohibited.** The recreational\nuse of nitrous oxide is also prohibited under this policy.\n\nIn addition, every employee is prohibited from being under the influence of\ncontrolled substances, alcohol, or any substance that may impair the\nemployee\u2019s ability to perform their job duties safely or productively, or that\nmay otherwise impair their senses, coordination, or judgment while on duty.\nAny employee reporting to work (or otherwise at work) under the influence of,\nor having present in their body, any prescribed drug or medication that may\nadversely affect the employee\u2019s ability to work in a safe, productive, or\nefficient manner, must advise the Disability and Leave Unit. Caltech may\nrequire an employee to submit to drug and alcohol testing consistent with\nCaltech policy and applicable federal and state law. Testing procedures that\napply to JPL employees are available on the JPL Human Resources website.\n\n###  2.2 Requirements for Employees and Students\n\nAs a condition of continued enrollment, every student is required to comply\nwith this policy. As a condition of employment, all Caltech employees (this\nincludes faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars, and student employees),\nregardless of their location, are required to comply with this policy. A\nCaltech employee who violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary\naction up to and including termination of employment. A violation of this\npolicy is likely to result in termination, even for a first offense.\nSimilarly, all students, not just student employees, should understand that\ndisciplinary action including involuntary leave or expulsion from Caltech may\nbe invoked for violation of this policy and that intoxication is never an\nexcuse for misconduct.\n\nCaltech may contact a student\u2019s parents when a student under 21 violates this\npolicy. If a student\u2019s behavior with respect to alcohol and drugs presents a\ndanger to themselves or others, Caltech may inform the parents.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to federal law, a student\u2019s eligibility for federal\nfinancial aid may be suspended if the student is convicted, under federal or\nstate law, of any offense involving the possession or sale of illegal drugs.\n\nA faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholar, or student who is convicted (including\na plea of nolo contendere [no contest]) of a criminal drug statute violation\noccurring in the workplace or on Caltech property must notify Caltech in\nwriting within five (5) calendar days after the conviction. Campus employees\nshould inform the assistant vice president of human resources, and students\nshould inform their dean. JPL employees should inform the manager of employee\nrelations.\n\n###  2.3 Third Party Requirements\n\nPersons who are not employees of Caltech but who perform work at Caltech for\nits benefit (such as contractors and their employees, temporary employees\nprovided by agencies, volunteers, guests, and visitors engaged in joint\nprojects at Caltech, etc.), are required to comply with this policy. Violation\nof this policy is likely to result in being barred from the workplace even for\na first offense.\n\n##  3.0 Health Risks\n\nThe use of any mind- or mood-altering substance, including alcohol, can lead\nto psychological dependence, which is defined as a need or craving for the\nsubstance and feelings of restlessness, tension, or anxiety when the substance\nis not used. In addition, with many substances, use can lead to physical\ntolerance, characterized by the need for increasing amounts of the substance\nto achieve the same effect, and/or physical dependence, characterized by the\nonset of unpleasant or painful physiological symptoms when the substance is no\nlonger being used. As tolerance and psychological or physical dependence\ndevelop, judgment becomes impaired, and the individual often does not realize\nthey are losing control over the use of the substance and that they need help.\n\nIt is impossible to predict accurately how an individual will react to a\nspecific drug or to alcohol because effects vary depending on the person,\nenvironmental variables, the dosage and potency of the substance, the method\nof taking the substance, the frequency of use, and whether the substance is\ntaken in conjunction with other substances. Illegal drugs have particularly\nunpredictable effects due to variability in dosage and purity. Further, the\noverall potency of street drugs has increased dramatically over the past two\ndecades, making users increasingly susceptible to negative effects.\n\nAlcohol acts as a depressant to the central nervous system and can cause\nserious short- and long-term damage. Short-term effects include nausea,\nvomiting, and ulcers; more chronic abuse can lead to brain, liver, kidney, and\nheart damage, and even to eventual death. Ingesting a large amount of alcohol\nat one time can lead to alcohol poisoning, coma, and death. Drugs such as LSD,\namphetamines, marijuana, and alcohol alter emotion, cognition, perception,\nphysiology, and behavior in a variety of ways. Health risks include but are\nnot limited to depression, apathy, hallucinations, paranoia, and impaired\njudgment, and all substances have an adverse effect on pregnancy and the\nfetus. When two or more substances are combined, the effect is often stronger\nthan their additive sum.\n\n##  4.0 Local, State, and Federal Legal Sanctions\n\nLocal, state, and federal laws establish severe penalties for violations of\ndrug and alcohol statutes. These sanctions, upon conviction, may range from a\nfine to life imprisonment. In the case of possession and distribution of\nillegal drugs, these sanctions could include the seizure and summary\nforfeiture of property, including vehicles. It is especially important to know\nthat federal laws have established penalties for illegally distributing drugs\nto include life imprisonment and fines of up to $10,000,000.\n\n###  4.1 Examples\n\n  * Unlawful possession of a narcotic drug is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison.\n  * The purchase, possession, or consumption of any alcoholic beverages (including beer and wine) by any person under the age of 21 is prohibited.\n  * It is illegal to provide alcohol to a person under the age of 21.\n  * Serving alcohol to an intoxicated person is prohibited.\n  * Selling any alcoholic beverages, except under the authority of a California Alcoholic Beverage Control License, is prohibited.\n  * It is a felony to induce another person to take various drugs and \"intoxicating agents\" with the intent of enabling oneself or the drugged person to commit a felony. The person who induced the other may be regarded as a principal in any crime committed.\n  * Any person found in a public place to be under the influence of an intoxicating liquor or drug and unable to care for their own safety, or who is interfering with the use of a public way, is guilty of disorderly conduct, which is a misdemeanor.\n  * It is illegal for a person to possess nitrous oxide (e.g., whippets) with the intent to inhale it for the purpose of altering their mood or mental functioning.\n\n##  5.0 Resources for Staff, Faculty, Postdoctoral Scholars and Students\n\nCaltech recognizes drug and alcohol abuse and dependency as treatable\nconditions and offers faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars, and students\nsupport programs for individuals with substance use problems. Faculty, staff,\nand postdoctoral scholars are encouraged to seek assistance for drug- and\nalcohol-related problems through the Caltech Staff and Faculty Consultation\nCenter (SFCC) at campus and the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) at JPL.\nIndividuals can contact the SFCC by calling [(626) 395-8360](tel:\\(626\\)\n395-8360), and the EAP by calling [(800) 367-7474](tel:\\(800\\) 367-7474).\nStudents are encouraged to seek assistance from the [Student Wellness\nServices](https://wellness.caltech.edu/) (SWS) at [(626) 395-8331](tel:\\(626\\)\n395-8331). In addition, faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars, and students\ncan seek confidential referral information through the Center for Inclusion &\nDiversity at [(626) 395-3221](tel:\\(626\\) 395-3221).\n\nThe staff of the SFCC, the EAP, and the SWS will help employees and students\nto identify appropriate treatment resources and will refer them to counseling,\ntreatment, or rehabilitation programs, as appropriate. Health insurance plans\nprovide varying amounts of coverage for substance-abuse programs to address\nsubstance abuse and rehabilitation. Individuals may contact their health\nproviders or the Caltech Human Resources Benefits office at campus at [(626)\n395-6443](tel:\\(626\\) 395-6443), or JPL at [(818) 354-4447](tel:\\(818\\)\n354-4447), for plan details. Information obtained regarding a faculty, staff,\npostdoctoral scholar, or student during voluntary participation in services at\nthe SFCC, EAP, SWS, or any related program will be treated as strictly\nconfidential, and no information, including whether or not an individual is\nreceiving services, will be shared with third parties, except by written\nconsent or as required by law.\n\n##  6.0 Drug and Alcohol Awareness Program\n\nCaltech has established and will maintain a drug and alcohol awareness program\nto educate faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars, and students about:\n\n  1. Caltech's substance abuse policy;\n  2. the dangers of drugs and alcohol in a work and academic environment;\n  3. faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholar, and student assistance programs; and  \ndisciplinary action that may be imposed on faculty, staff, postdoctoral\nscholars, and students for violations of this policy.\n\nCaltech will distribute to all faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars, and\nstudents a copy of this policy on an annual basis.\n\n##  7.0 Supervisor\u2019s Responsibilities\n\nIf an employee is suspected of violating this policy, the employee\u2019s\nsupervisor should consult with Employee and Organizational Development (EOD)\nat campus or the Employee Relations Department of the Human Resources\nDirectorate at JPL regarding appropriate actions, which may include an\ninvestigation and discipline up to and including termination of employment. If\na supervisor believes an employee\u2019s behavior raises safety concerns for the\nemployee or others, the supervisor must take immediate action, including\ncalling EOD on campus or the Employee Relations Department of the Human\nResources Directorate at JPL, to assess and address the situation and to\nremove the employee from the worksite if necessary.\n\n##  8.0 Caltech Sanctions\n\nCaltech will impose sanctions for violations of or failure to comply with the\nrequirements of this policy. These sanctions will be consistently enforced and\npenalties will depend on the severity of the offenses. Penalties may include\nemployment termination, student expulsion, being permanently banned from\nCaltech premises, and referral to law enforcement for the most serious\nviolations of the law and this policy (e.g., the manufacture or distribution\nof banned substances). Disciplinary action may be invoked entirely apart from\nany civil or criminal penalties that the faculty, staff, postdoctoral\nscholars, and students might incur.\n\n"

Abusive conduct, also\nreferred to as bullying, is malicious conduct occurring in a work or\neducational setting that a reasonable person would find hostile, offensive,\nand unrelated to Caltech\u2019s legitimate business or educational interests.\nExamples of abusive conduct may include:\n\n  * repeated infliction of verbal abuse, such as the use of derogatory remarks, insults, verbal epithets;\n  * physical conduct that can be considered threatening, intimidating, or humiliating;\n  * a single act shall not constitute abusive conduct, unless especially severe and egregious;\n\nCaltech is committed to educating the community in ways to prevent harassment\nand abusive contact. Caltech requires all employees, including those\nresponsible for directing or supervising other Caltech employees or evaluating\nthe work of students, to regularly participate in training regarding\nharassment, and the prevention of harassment and other abusive conduct,\nconsistent with federal and state legal requirements.\n\n##  2.0 Scope\n\nThis policy applies to all members of the Caltech community, including at JPL\n(students, faculty, supervisory and nonsupervisory employees, postdoctoral\nscholars, volunteers, interns, vendors, contractors, persons performing\nservices under contract with Caltech, visitors, and any other individuals\nregularly or temporarily employed, studying, living, visiting, or otherwise\nparticipating in Caltech\u2019s employment and education programs and activities).\nThis policy applies to conduct occurring on Institute-controlled property, at\nInstitute-sponsored events and in Institute employment and education programs\nand activities regardless of location.\n\n##  3.0 Reporting Complaints and Concerns\n\nCaltech\u2019s ability to remedy harassment and abusive conduct and maintain an\nenvironment free of harassment and abusive conduct is limited if incidents are\nnot reported. Anyone who witnesses, experiences, or is otherwise aware of\nconduct that they believe to be in violation of this policy, including\nretaliation, is urged to immediately report it, or to request assistance and\nguidance. Complaints or concerns about harassment should be reported to the\nEquity and Title IX Office or one of the Equal Employment Opportunity\ncoordinators listed below, at campus, or the Employee Relations Group at JPL.\nReports may be made at any time. A delay should not discourage anyone from\nreporting harassment. Delayed reporting is better than no reporting. Reports\nmay be made in writing or orally. Harassment complaints are addressed under\nthe [Procedures for Complaints of Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment and\nRetaliation](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2704/caltech_institute_procedure-\ncomplaints_of_unlawful_discrimination_harassment_and_retaliation.pdf).\n\nComplaints or concerns about abusive conduct (1) against a student should be\nreported to the appropriate dean, (2) against a staff member or postdoctoral\nscholar to Employee & Organizational Development, (3) against a faculty member\nto the appropriate Division Chair or the Office of the Provost, and (4)\nagainst a JPL employee to Employee Relations at JPL. In order to make an\nappropriate judgment as to whether incidents are appropriately investigated as\nharassment or abusive conduct, the full context in which the conduct occurred\nwill be evaluated. Complaints are considered based on the totality of the\nfacts and circumstances.\n\nWhile the Procedures for Complaints of Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment and\nRetaliation do not apply to complaints of abusive conduct, Caltech will\nconduct a fair, timely, and thorough investigation into or review of\ncomplaints of such conduct and take appropriate steps to address any abusive\nconduct that is found to have occurred.\n\nMembers of the Caltech community are encouraged to err on the side of\nreporting any conduct they think may be harassment or abusive conduct covered\nunder this policy, regardless of where the incident occurred or who committed\nit. Even if Caltech does not have jurisdiction over the incident or the\nperpetrator, Caltech will take reasonable action to remedy the effects of the\nharassment or abusive conduct on the Caltech community and prevent any\nreoccurrence of the behavior.\n\nAny employee in a supervisory role, including faculty, must promptly report\n**all** alleged harassment, discrimination, gender-based misconduct, and\nretaliation, regardless of its alleged severity or frequency, to the Equity\nand Title IX Office at campus or Human Resources at JPL, which will provide\nguidance and advice. In addition, other employees qualifying as responsible\nemployees under the [Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct\nPolicy,](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2925/caltech_institute_policy-\nsex_and_gender_based_misconduct.pdf) Section II, Reporting Concerns and\nComplaints, subsection 6.2, must promptly report any instance of prohibited\nconduct, as defined in Section III, Prohibited Conduct Sections 15.0 and 16.0\nto the Equity and Title IX Office or the Deputy Title IX coordinator for JPL,\nas appropriate.\n\nIf a member of the Caltech community would like support and guidance in filing\na complaint, they may contact one of the Equal Opportunity coordinators, the\nassistant vice president for equity and equity investigations in the Equity\nand Title IX Office, JPL\u2019s manager of employee relations, or the JPL section\nmanager of talent management or Human Resources Business Partners at JPL.\n\n##  4.0 Anonymous Reporting\n\nCaltech provides the following resources for anonymous reporting:\n\n  * Campus Hotline: [(626) 395-8787](tel:\\(626\\) 395-8787) or [(888) 395-8787](tel:\\(888\\) 395-8787)\n  * Equity and Title IX Office Online Report a Concern Form (complete anonymously): [Online Report Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=2elb_XJ7-U2DDrH5zFtEvUobj3A0Xb1PpGAk36xut5VUNThMTkdSWU1JVVlMRkhPU09USlA2QlBQNCQlQCN0PWcu) | Equity and Title IX Office (caltech.edu)\n  * JPL Ethics Hotline: [(818) 354-9999](tel:\\(818\\) 354-9999)\n  * JPL Protective Services Division\u2019s Workplace Violence Hotline: [(818) 393-2851](tel:\\(818\\) 393-2851)\n  * For either Campus or JPL by submitting a compliance Hotline Contact Form\n\nIf the reporting party wants to remain anonymous, they should not share any\npersonally identifying information. If the reporting party does share such\ninformation, the Equity and Title IX Office will contact the reporting party\nwith information about support resources and reporting options; if an\ninvestigation is pursued, the reporting party who identified themselves will\nbe notified.\n\n##  5.0 Contacting Outside Agencies\n\nIn addition, employees who believe they have been unlawfully harassed on the\nbasis of a protected characteristic have the right to file a complaint with\nthe federal [Equal Employment](https://www.eeoc.gov/) [Opportunity\nCommission](https://www.eeoc.gov/) or the [California Civil Rights\nDepartment](https://www.dfeh.ca.gov/), which have the authority to remedy\nviolations.

Complaints of\nharassment will be investigated under the Procedures for Complaints of\nUnlawful Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation. Caltech provides all\n\nparties with appropriate due process and reaches conclusions based on the\nevidence collected. Caltech takes appropriate action, including disciplinary\nmeasures up to and including termination of employment, student expulsion, or\nbeing permanently excluded from Caltech-controlled premises, when warranted.\n\n##  7.0 Prohibition Against Retaliation\n\nNo one may intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any\nindividual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured\nby this policy or the related procedures, or because the individual has made a\nreport or complaint, testified, assisted, participated, or refused to\nparticipate in any manner in any action or process under this policy or the\nrelated procedures. Intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination, for\nthe purpose of interfering with any right under this policy or the related\nprocedures constitutes retaliation. The rights and privileges secured under\nthis policy and the related procedures include but are not limited to: (i)\nfiling or assisting in the filing of a complaint or report of a suspected\nviolation of this policy; (ii) opposing any act or practice made unlawful by\nany federal, state, or local laws requiring equal opportunity; (iii)\nparticipating, assisting, or otherwise cooperating in an investigation,\ncompliance review, hearing, or any other activity related to a violation of\nthis policy or administration of any federal, state, or local law requiring\nequal opportunity; and/or (iv) exercising any legal right protected by\nfederal, state or local law requiring equal opportunity. Complaints of\nretaliation will be addressed under the [Procedures for Complaints of\nUnlawful](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2704/caltech_institute_procedure-\ncomplaints_of_unlawful_discrimination_harassment_and_retaliation.pdf)\n[Discrimination, Harassment and\nRetaliation](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2704/caltech_institute_procedure-\ncomplaints_of_unlawful_discrimination_harassment_and_retaliation.pdf).\n\nThe following actions do not constitute retaliation: the exercise of rights\nprotected under applicable law or Caltech\u2019s charging an individual with a\npolicy violation for making a materially false statement in bad faith in the\ncourse of a resolution process. A determination that a respondent was or was\nnot responsible for alleged misconduct alone is not sufficient to conclude\nthat any party made a materially false statement in bad faith.\n\n##  8.0 Privacy\n\nA member of the Caltech community who wishes to report unlawful\ndiscrimination, harassment, abusive conduct, or retaliation should do so as\nsoon as possible, although reports (hereinafter \u201ccomplaints\u201d) may be made at\nany time. Complaints can be made orally or in writing. Complaints should be\nbrought to the attention of one of the individuals designated in this policy.\n\nPrivacy generally means that information related to a report of harassment or\nabusive conduct will only be shared with those individuals who have a \u201cneed to\nknow.\u201d The determination of who has a \u201cneed to know\u201d is within the discretion\nof Caltech. These individuals are required to be discreet and respect the\nprivacy of all individuals involved.\n\nNo meetings or conversations that take place under this policy or the\nProcedures for Complaints of Unlawful Discrimination, Harassment, and\nRetaliation may be audio-visually recorded by anyone.\n\n##  9.0 Confidential Resources\n\nCaltech offers members of the Caltech community the choice of seeking\nconfidential counseling outside of Caltech\u2019s procedural mechanisms for\nresolving harassment and abusive complaints. These confidential counseling\nservices are intended for the personal benefit of the individual and offer a\nsetting where various courses of action can be explored. Members of the\nCaltech community may access the offices below for confidential support.\nCounselors and designated confidential advocates in these offices will listen\nand help identify options and next steps. Talking to any of these staff\nmembers does not constitute reporting an incident to Caltech.\n\nConfidentiality generally means that information shared by an individual with\ndesignated campus or community professionals cannot be revealed to any other\nindividual without the express permission of the individual. These\nprofessionals are listed below. They are prohibited from breaking\nconfidentiality unless there is an imminent threat of harm to self or others\nor as otherwise required or permitted by law. When a report involves suspected\nabuse of a minor under the age of 18, these confidential resources may be\nrequired by state law to notify child protective services and/or local law\nenforcement.\n\nAn individual who has experienced unlawful harassment and who first requests\nconfidentiality may later decide to file a complaint with Caltech.

All athletic coaches, including\nassistant coaches and graduate assistants involved in coaching, are mandated\nreporters under part (a) of the definition above and must report child abuse\nor neglect no matter where it occurs. Certain other professionals at Caltech,\nsuch as medical and mental health professionals, are also mandated reporters\nunder part (a).\n\nMandated reporters must report child abuse and neglect whenever, in their\nprofessional capacity or within the scope of their employment, they observe or\nreasonably suspect it. A mandated reporter should reasonably suspect child\nabuse or neglect whenever \u201cit is objectively reasonable \u2026 to entertain such a\nsuspicion, based upon facts that could cause a reasonable person in a like\nposition, drawing, when appropriate, on his or her training and experience, to\nsuspect child abuse or neglect.\u201d (Penal Code \u00a7 11166(a)).\n\nMandated reporters must report child abuse and neglect whenever, in their\nprofessional capacity or within the scope of their employment, they observe or\nreasonably suspect it.

Course of conduct means two or more acts,\nincluding, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly,\nor through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, follows,\nmonitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person\nor interferes with the person\u2019s property. Reasonable person means a reasonable\nperson under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the victim.\nStalking that is sex or gender-based should be reported and will be handled\npursuant to the Sex-and Gender-Based Misconduct policy and applicable\nprocedures. Stalking that is not sex or gender-based is covered by this\npolicy.\n\nWeapon is defined as a firearm, ammunition, BB or pellet gun, paintball gun,\nstun gun, compressed air gun, or any replica firearm, martial arts weapon,\nfireworks, explosives, dangerous or highly flammable chemicals, dirk, dagger,\nice pick, or knife having a blade longer than 2 1/2 inches (except for a knife\nor ice pick used for food preparation or consumption or for a lawful use in or\naround a residence), razor with an unguarded blade, razor blade, or box cutter\n(except for a razor, razor blade or box cutter for lawful use in a residence),\nor any object when used in a manner or under a circumstance that potentially\nmay or does result in an act of violence or threat of violence.\n\nAn object otherwise defined above as a weapon is excepted when used for a\nlawful purpose within the scope of the person\u2019s employment or academic\nactivities when approved by Caltech.\n\n###  2.5 Investigating Prohibited Conduct\n\nReports of conduct that may violate any aspect of this policy will be taken\nseriously, properly investigated, and dealt with accordingly. Individuals who\nare found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action\nup to and including termination of employment, student expulsion, or being\npermanently excluded from Caltech-controlled premises.

        "content": "##  1.0 Introduction\n\nCaltech will take prompt and appropriate action to address all reports of\nunlawful discrimination, harassment, and retaliation in accordance with these\nand related procedures. Caltech takes all such reports seriously and responds\nappropriately.\n\nThese procedures apply to the following:\n\nAt Campus and JPL, these procedures apply to allegations of unlawful\ndiscrimination, harassment, and retaliation that are not covered under\nCaltech\u2019s [Sex Discrimination\nPolicy](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2925/caltech_institute_policy-\nsex_and_gender_based_misconduct.pdf) and Sex Discrimination Procedures.\n\nCaltech\u2019s Sex Discrimination Procedures apply to allegations of Prohibited\nConduct, as defined in the [Sex Discrimination\nPolicy](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2925/caltech_institute_policy-\ngender_based_misconduct.pdf).\n\nA member of the Caltech community who wishes to report unlawful\ndiscrimination, harassment, or retaliation should do so as soon as possible,\nalthough reports (hereinafter \u201ccomplaints\u201d) may be made at any time.\nComplaints can be made orally or in writing. Complaints should be brought to\nthe attention of the Title IX Coordinator or one of the individuals designated\nin the Unlawful Harassment Policy.\n\nAny reference to a Caltech administrator in this document is understood to\ninclude not only that administrator but also their designee.\n\n##  2.0 Complaint\n\nComplaints of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation can be reported to\nthe individuals designated in the [Unlawful Harassment and Abusive Conduct\nPolicy](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2641/caltech_institute_policy-\nunlawful_harassment.pdf).\n\nConsistent with Caltech\u2019s Unlawful Harassment and Abusive Conduct Policy,\nCaltech will conduct a fair, timely, and thorough investigation into\ncomplaints within the scope of this policy to determine what occurred and take\nreasonable steps to remedy the effects of any harassment and prevent\nreoccurrence of the behavior. Caltech provides all parties with appropriate\ndue process and reaches conclusions based on the evidence collected. Caltech\ntakes appropriate action, including disciplinary measures, when warranted.\n\nThe complainant and the respondent may object to an investigator/s assigned to\na complaint only on the basis that the investigator has a conflict or cannot\nbe impartial. The Equity and Title IX Office on campus or Human Resources at\nJPL will consider any objections and notify the parties of the decision\nrelated to the investigator/s. Such objections must be made in writing to the\nEquity and Title IX Office on campus or to the manager of Employee Relations\nat JPL and must include the reason for the objection.\n\nAt any time, Caltech may put in place supportive or interim measures as\nappropriate to support the complainant, the respondent and/or others.\n\n##  3.0 Investigation Steps\n\n  * The complainant and respondent will be provided with a copy of the Nondiscrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity policy, the Unlawful Harassment policy, the Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy, and/or these procedures, as appropriate.\n  * Within a reasonable length of time after the complaint has been reported, the complainant and the respondent will each be notified of the allegations to be investigated.\n  * The complainant and respondent will be informed that Caltech does not tolerate retaliation, takes steps to prevent retaliation, and takes strong responsive action if retaliation occurs. The complainant and respondent will be advised to notify Caltech immediately if retaliation occurs.\n  * The investigation will be treated as private to the extent possible. Caltech will make reasonable and appropriate efforts to preserve the complainant\u2019s and respondent\u2019s privacy and protect the confidentiality of information but may need to share information on a need-to-know basis.\n  * Parties may not engage in coercion, pressure, undue influence, or retaliation with respect to potential witnesses or other parties in the course of preparing to meet with and providing evidence to the investigator. Parties may seek guidance from the Assistant Vice President, Equity and Equity Investigations and the investigator on appropriate communications. Communications between parties and witnesses deemed to have resulted from coercion, pressure, undue influence, or retaliation may be discounted altogether by the investigator or may be considered by the investigator in making credibility determinations and weighing evidence deemed subject to the undue influence.\n  * The investigation and adjudication of alleged prohibited conduct under this section is not an adversarial process between the complainant, the respondent, and the witnesses, but rather a process by which Caltech complies with its obligations under existing law and determines whether the allegations are substantiated by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  * The complainant and the respondent will be given an opportunity to be interviewed regarding the allegations and may suggest witnesses or information to the investigator/s, who will determine whether the suggestions are relevant, appropriate, or necessary to resolve disputed-fact issues. The investigator/s may also review other information and interview others they determine may have information relevant to investigating and resolving the complaint.\n  * Legal counsel and other advisers or support persons are not permitted to be present during interviews. Investigatory meetings will not be recorded by any party involved in a case.\n  * Complaints will be investigated and resolved within a reasonably prompt time frame after the complaint has been made, though factors, including but not limited to the complexity of the case, may impact the duration of the investigation. It is within the discretion of the Assistant Vice President of Equity or Human Resources at campus, or the Manager of Employee Relations at JPL, to determine whether to conclude an investigation without further opportunity to provide evidence by a party or witness who fails to cooperate reasonably and timely in providing evidence (e.g., failing to schedule or appear for meetings, failing to provide evidence they said they would provide, ignoring communications from the investigator).\n  * The investigator/s will use the preponderance of the evidence standard in reaching findings and conclusions. A preponderance of the evidence means that it is more likely than not that the alleged misconduct occurred or did not occur.\n  * The investigation will not require, allow, rely upon, or use questions or evidence that constitute or seek the disclosure of information protected under a legally recognized privilege (e.g., attorney-client, doctor-patient, clergy-penitent), unless the person holding such privilege has waived the privilege.\n  * The investigator/s will reach findings and conclusions in the case, regarding whether the allegations are substantiated by a preponderance of the evidence, based on the facts available at the time of the decision and will report these to the appropriate administrator (\u201cdecision maker\u201d) who will decide responsive measures, including any appropriate discipline. The appropriate decision makers are the following: the appropriate manager or supervisor for Campus and JPL staff and employee respondents; the Vice Provost for Research or Administration for faculty respondents; and the appropriate dean for student respondents.\n  * The complainant and the respondent will be notified of the outcome of the process.\n  * Either party may submit an appeal of the outcome, in accordance with Section 6.0 below.\n  * Exceptions to or modifications of these procedures can be made by the Associate Vice President for Human Resources at campus or the Director for Human Resources at JPL, or their designee.\n\nInvestigative files are confidential and will be maintained in a file separate\nfrom an individual\u2019s personnel or student file. Disciplinary action taken\nagainst an employee as a result of an investigation will be included in the\npersonnel file.\n\n##  4.0 False Reports or Statements\n\nCaltech expects its members to act with honesty, sincerity, and good faith in\nreporting concerns under this policy. Caltech will not tolerate intentional\nfalse reporting of information, allegations, or evidence. A good faith\ncomplaint that is not substantiated by a preponderance of the evidence after\nan investigation is not considered a false report.\n\nHowever, when a party or witness is found to have intentionally fabricated or\nknowingly misrepresented information, allegations, or evidence, or otherwise\nto have acted with an intent to deceive or mislead in any of their dealings\nrelating to Caltech\u2019s administration of this policy, they may be subject to\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination or expulsion.\n\n##  5.0 Resolution\n\nThe conclusions that the investigator/s might reach, include but are not\nlimited to:\n\nA violation of Institute policy or other inappropriate conduct occurred.\n\n  * Inappropriate conduct occurred, but it did not constitute a violation of Institute policy.\n\nFor example, the respondent used poor judgment.\n\n  * The allegations were not supported by the preponderance of the evidence.\n  * The allegations were brought in bad faith.\n\nIf appropriate, the decision maker(s) will review the findings, conclusions,\nand recommendations, and determine appropriate actions in consultation with\nthe investigating office (Equity and Title IX Office at Campus, Human\nResources at JPL). Both the complainant and the respondent will be informed of\nthe findings and notified when appropriate action has been taken.\n\nIf a violation of Institute policy or other inappropriate conduct occurred,\nappropriate corrective action will be taken. Depending on the severity of the\ncase, possible corrective actions include verbal counseling, a formal written\nwarning, removal from a supervisory position, and, in appropriate cases,\ntermination of employment or expulsion.\n\nCaltech will also take any necessary steps to protect the complainant from\nretaliatory actions by the respondent and/or others.\n\nIf it is determined that the allegations were brought in bad faith,\nappropriate action will be taken to address the situation.\n\nBoth the complainant and the respondent will be notified concurrently in\nwriting of the results of the investigation, their right to appeal and the\nprocedures for appeal. Privacy considerations prevent Caltech from informing a\ncomplainant of any sanctions or other remedies imposed against a respondent.\n\n##  6.0 Appeals of Investigation Outcomes\n\n  * Appeals by either party must be in writing, no more than five pages in length, and submitted within ten (10) calendar days of notification of the decision. Appeals of decisions resulting from the investigation process must be on the grounds that a procedural error occurred that would have significantly affected the outcome of the investigation, or there is new evidence which would have significantly affected the outcome that was not available at the time of the proceeding. A procedural error is an error in how the investigation was conducted. A respondent also may appeal on the ground that the sanction is substantially disproportionate to the findings. In appeals on the ground that there is new evidence which would have significantly affected the outcome that was not available at the time of the proceeding, the party appealing should provide the new evidence and an explanation of why the evidence was not available during the investigation. Appeals that are not based on one or more of these grounds will not be considered and will be denied. Appeal decisions are final.\n  * Decisions regarding a faculty respondent may be appealed to the Office of the Provost. Decisions regarding a staff respondent, including post docs, may be appealed to the Assistant Vice President for Human Resources. Decisions regarding student respondents may be appealed to the Vice President of Student Affairs. Decisions regarding employees at JPL may be appealed to the Director of Human Resources at JPL. Decisions of the appropriate dean for students may be appealed to the Vice President for Student Affairs.\n\n##  7.0 Further Complaints\n\nThe complainant should immediately report if the corrective action does not\nend the unlawful discrimination or harassment, or if new or continuing\nunlawful discrimination or harassment occurs. In such cases, the complainant\nhas the right to file another complaint.\n\n##  8.0 Distribution of the Procedures\n\nThese procedures will be distributed annually to faculty, staff, and students,\nand upon arrival to faculty, staff, or student newcomers to Caltech. In the\nevent that any significant revisions are made, revised versions will be\ndistributed.\n\n##  9.0 Exceptions\n\nExceptions to or modifications of these procedures can be made by the\nassociate Vice President for Human Resources at campus or the Director for\nHuman Resources at JPL.\n\n##  Related Policies and Procedures:\n\n  * [Nondiscrimination and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2647/caltech_institute_policy-nondiscrmination_and_equal_opportunity_employment.pdf)\n  * [Unlawful Harassment and Abusive Conduct Policy](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2641/caltech_institute_policy-unlawful_harassment.pdf)\n  * [Sex Discrimination Policy](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/2925/caltech_institute_policy-sex_and_gender_based_misconduct.pdf)\n  * [Procedures for Complaints of Sexual Misconduct Under Title IX and the California Education Code](https://hr.caltech.edu/documents/3565/caltech_institute_procedure-complaints_of_sexual_misconduct_under_title_ix_and_the_california_education_code.pdf)\n  * [Violence Prevention Policy](https://hr70.divisions.caltech.edu/documents/2924/caltech_institute_policy-violence_prevention.pdf)\n\n"

        "content": "The Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory, the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Laboratory of Fluid\nMechanics and Jet Propulsion, and the Firestone Flight Sciences Laboratory\nform the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories, widely known as GALCIT. In this\ncomplex are housed the solid mechanics, impact mechanics, and deployable space\nstructures laboratories, the hypersonics and hydrodynamics facilities, the\nexplosion dynamics and detonation physics laboratories, and the Joe and Edwina\nCharyk Laboratory of Bioinspired Design and Biopropulsion, the Center for\nAutonomous Systems and Technologies, as well as the various disciplines making\nup the broad field known as aerospace.\n\n##  Areas of Research\n\nAerospace has evolved at Caltech from a field of basic research and\nengineering, primarily related to the development of the airplane, into a wide\ndiscipline encompassing a broad spectrum of basic as well as applied problems\nin fluid dynamics and mechanics of solids and materials and design and control\nof autonomous systems. Educational and research thrusts include the\napplication of mechanics to various aspects of space exploration and to the\nstudy of biosystems and biopropulsion. Research at GALCIT has traditionally\npioneered exploration of areas that have anticipated subsequent technological\ndemands. This tradition places a high premium on in-depth understanding of\nfields both closely and remotely related to the behavior of fluids, solids,\ncombustion, materials, and structures, such as physics, applied and\ncomputational mathematics, dynamical systems, earthquake physics, atmospheric\nstudies, materials science, micro- and optoelectronics, microfluidics,\nbioinspired design, biomedical devices, and even astrophysics. GALCIT students\nare known and sought after for their broad yet intense education and for their\nability to deal with new and challenging problems.\n\nMajor areas of experimental, theoretical, and numerical research currently\npursued by aerospace students at Caltech are briefly described below.\n\n  * _Mechanics of Lightweight Space Structures._ Current efforts in the field of next-generation deployable space structures aim to increase reliability and also lower fabrication and assembly costs by moving toward structures that consist of only a small number of separate pieces able to undergo large elastic deformations. These elastic\u2013stored-energy structures return to their original, unstressed configuration when they are released in orbit. The design of these structures requires accurate structural models that incorporate geometry change and contact effects in sufficient detail to capture the actual behavior that is observed in ground tests. Local and global instabilities are often observed during folding/deployment, and their effects can also be very important. Ultimately, validation against space-based experiments will be pursued for a selected number of structural configurations. In parallel to these studies, thermomechanical constitutive models for ultrathin composite materials for these novel deployable space structures are being developed. Extensive studies of the deployment, elastic, and viscoelastic stability of stratospheric balloons are also being conducted.\n  * _Physics of Fluids._ Fluid dynamics as a discipline is as much a part of physics as of engineering. Physics of fluids refers to research in areas closer to applied physics than to direct technical applications. Present active research includes studies in gas dynamics and hypervelocity flows, diffraction and focusing of shock waves, detonation waves, shock-induced Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmeyer-Meshkov instabilities, transient supersonic jets, the development of laser-scattering diagnostic techniques for fluid-flow measurements, the study of structures and mechanics in transition and turbulence, studies of two-phase flows and turbulent mixing, chemically reacting flows, and experimental manipulation and control of wall-bounded flows for improved flow characteristics, such as reduction of drag, noise, and structural loading.\n  * _Physics of Solids and Mechanics of Materials._ Mechanics of materials research involves both the quasi-static and dynamic characterization of the mechanical behavior and failure of solids. In order to understand materials for applications in a wide range of structures germane to aerospace as well as other engineering disciplines, both the physical foundations of that behavior and the mathematical or numerical representation of such behavior needs to be understood. Accordingly, studies involve material response at both the macroscopic (continuum) scales and the micro- and nanoscales. Of interest are the typical engineering metals, multiphase (composite) materials, polymers and ceramics, thin film materials used in microelectronic and optoelectronic applications, soft tissue mechanics of materials, and active materials used in structural actuation and controls. Other areas of active research include the study of highly nonlinear dynamics in solids, multiscale acoustic metamaterials, the analysis and design of mechanical metamaterials for the extreme conditions in air and space applications, and nondestructive evaluation/structural health monitoring of structures.\n  * _Space Technology._ The goal of industrial utilization and exploration of space requires that one addresses a wide range of engineering problems. Examples of research activities include lightweight structures for large aperture systems, in-space manufacturing, material and structural behavior in extreme temperature and radiation environments, spacecraft shielding against hypervelocity impact threats, the mechanics of sample containment for planetary protection, low-g biomechanics, biomimetics of locomotion in planetary atmospheres, hypersonic reentry into planetary atmospheres, in-space propulsion, guidance, navigation and control, and launch-vehicle performance and safety. Opportunities exist for research in collaboration with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n  * _Computational Solid Mechanics._ Computational solid mechanics addresses phenomena ranging from the atomistic scale, e.g., nanostructured materials or nanoscale structures and devices, to the structural scale, e.g., fracture of aircraft or spacecraft components, modeling of large space structures or even dynamic fragmentation phenomena accompanying hypervelocity impact. It provides an indispensable tool for understanding the relation between structure and mechanical properties of materials, for predicting the efficiency of such industrial processes as machining and metal forming, and for assessing the safety of such structures as airplanes, spacecraft, automobiles, and bridges. The goals and objectives of this activity are to provide a state-of-the-art environment for the development of numerical methods in solid mechanics, to provide the computational resources required for large-scale simulations in solid mechanics, and to serve as an instructional facility for advanced courses.\n  * _Computational and Theoretical Fluid Dynamics._ Many of the fluid dynamics phenomena studied experimentally at GALCIT are also being investigated by numerical simulation and by theoretical analysis. Present active research areas in computational and theoretical techniques include direct numerical simulation, particle methods for flow simulation, new algorithms and subgrid-scale models for compressible and incompressible flows, large-eddy simulation methods, flows with shocks and driven by shocks, analytical and computational techniques for turbulence structure diagnostics, analysis of turbulent mixing dynamics, high-explosive interactions with deformable boundaries, chemically reacting flows, and detailed chemical reaction kinetics in flames and detonations.\n  * _Mechanics of Fracture._ An active effort is being made to understand mechanisms in a wide range of fracture problems. Aspects that are studied include quasi-static and dynamic crack growth phenomena in brittle and plastically deforming solids, polymers and advanced composites, as well as fatigue and failure of adhesive bonds. Research areas adjunct to dynamic fracture studies are those of dynamic localization in metals and of failure in frictional interfaces. These include the study of shear rupture phenomena in both coherent and incoherent interfaces. The dynamic failure of modern composite and layered materials and the phenomenon of earthquake rupture growth along geological faults have motivated these studies.\n  * _Aeronautical Engineering and Propulsion._ Research in the aeronautical engineering area includes studies of airplane trailing vortices and separated flows at high angles of attack. Research work in the propulsion area has centered on the fluid dynamic problems associated with combustion, solid propellant rocket motor instabilities, fluid dynamics and optimization of scramjets, and pulse detonation engines. \n  * _Biomechanics of Fluids and Solids._ The kinematics and dynamics of fluid flows in biological systems are studied in experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical analyses. These flows are often characterized by unsteady vortex dynamics, coupled fluid interactions with flexible material surfaces, non-Newtonian fluid behavior, and, in some cases, compressibility. Areas of active research include animal swimming and flying, cardiovascular fluid dynamics and hemodynamics, the mechanics of morphing/active deformable surfaces for flow control, and biologically inspired design of engineering systems.\n  * _Technical Fluid Mechanics._ These areas are related to a variety of modern technological problems and, in addition, to the traditional aeronautical problems of drag, wing stall, and shear flow mixing. Additional areas of activity include bluff-body aerodynamics, fluid-structure interaction, turbulent combustion, laminar diffusion flames and their instabilities, explosions, hydrodynamics and two-phase flows, interaction of vorticity with free-surface, cardiac flows, swimming and flying, and active and passive control of transition and turbulence. Acoustics problems studied include jet noise, combustion noise, and instabilities such as the generation of organ pipe oscillations in large burners of electric generating plants.\n  * _Fluid Mechanics, Control, and Materials._ The effects of boundary conditions on turbulence characteristics and general flow physics, scaling and controllability are investigated using interdisciplinary methods based on developments in materials science and control techniques.

The small size of\nCaltech, coupled with its strength in the basic sciences and engineering, has\nmade it possible for faculty and students alike to pursue wide-ranging\ninterests in the application of modern physics to the development of new\ntechnology. Research efforts in applied physics are driven by a fundamental\nunderstanding of the physical principles underlying applications and a strong\nmotivation to use this knowledge to invent new experimental techniques,\nprocesses, devices and materials. Core and affiliate faculty spanning several\ndivisions on campus participate in instruction and research leading to B.S.,\nM.S., and Ph.D. degrees in applied physics.\n\nThis program is designed for undergraduate and graduate students who wish to\nexpand their training beyond the study of fundamental physics to include\nresearch and development of real-world applications. The training helps\ndevelop a solid foundation in physics through introductory courses in\nclassical physics, classical electrodynamics, quantum mechanics,\nthermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and mathematical physics. More advanced\ntraining is provided through coursework and research activities in solid state\nphysics, electromagnetic wave propagation, optoelectronic materials and\ndevices, transport phenomena in hydrodynamic and condensed matter systems,\nplasma physics, biological physics, semiconductor principles and devices,\nquantum electronics, and low-dimensional electronic systems.\n\nStudents are encouraged early on to develop strong experimental skills for\nadvanced laboratory work, including familiarity with numerical computation for\ndata and image analysis and software packages for instrument automation. There\nexist many learning opportunities along these lines, from courses in\nmicrofabrication and laboratory work to independent research opportunities\nwith various research groups.

Fundamental\ndiscoveries in astronomy and astrophysics are a part of Caltech\u2019s past,\npresent, and future.\n\nStudents from either the astronomy or the physics options are best prepared to\nundertake research with faculty in the Cahill Center for Astronomy and\nAstrophysics. Students from related options such as planetary science,\ncomputer science, applied physics, and electrical engineering are also\nwelcome.\n\n##  Areas of Research\n\nAstronomy and astrophysics are synonymous at Caltech. Caltech scientists and\nstudents are involved in many frontier areas of research, and have been known\nto open new ones. Research techniques include observations, theory, numerical\nsimulation, advanced data analysis, laboratory astrophysics, and detector\ndevelopment. Projects and groups often bridge these areas of inquiry.\n\nTopics of current research interest include: observational cosmology and the\nnature of dark matter and dark energy; studies of the cosmic microwave\nbackground; galaxy formation and evolution; quasars and other active galactic\nnuclei and radio sources; studies of the dynamics and composition of galaxies\nand clusters; physics and evolution of the intergalactic medium; interstellar\nmatter; local star and planet formation; extrasolar planetary systems; the\nstructure of the galaxy; globular clusters; stellar abundances; supernovae,\ngamma-ray bursts, and other types of cosmic explosions and transient\nphenomena; neutron stars and black holes; accretion disks; digital sky surveys\nand astroinformatics; numerical general relativity; gravitational wave\nastronomy and many others.\n\nResearch in planetary and solar system astronomy is often pursued in\ncooperation with groups in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences.\nNew types of astronomical detectors and satellites, that can revolutionize\nvarious areas of astronomical research, are developed with groups in physics\nand colleagues at JPL.\n\nIn addition to maintaining a leading numerical general relativity group,\nCaltech theorists also use high-performance computing facilities for\nsimulations of supernova explosions, merging black holes, cosmic structure\nformation, etc. Caltech is leading the development of novel tools for\nknowledge discovery in massive and complex astronomical data sets, many\nobtained with Caltech facilities.\n\n##  History and Current Science at Observational Facilities\n\nObservational astronomy is pursued both from the ground-based sites and from\nspace-based platforms. Caltech operates, or has access to an unprecedented,\ncomprehensive set of observational facilities, spanning the entire\nelectromagnetic spectrum. Caltech is also playing a key role in opening a new\nwindow on the universe, the gravitational wave sky.\n\nHistorically, Caltech\u2019s pioneering role in astronomy started with Palomar\nObservatory (about 190 km from campus), funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.\nThe first telescope on the mountain was an 18-inch Schmidt telescope built by\nFritz Zwicky and used to conduct pioneering sky surveys for supernovae,\npotential planetary hazard asteroids, etc. The 200-inch Hale Telescope,\nconstructed through the 1930s and 1940s, has been used to make many\nhistorical, fundamental discoveries ever since its commissioning in 1948,\nincluding the discovery of quasars, and many studies of stellar populations,\ngalaxies, intergalactic medium, etc., and it continues to produce excellent\nscience. Novel detectors and instruments were developed there, e.g., the first\nastronomical CCDs and infrared detectors as well as pioneering advances in\nadaptive optics in addition to optical and infrared spectroscopy. The 48-inch\nSamuel Oschin Telescope has made possible complete surveys of the northern\nsky, initially with photographic plates (including the historic POSS-I and\nPOSS-II surveys), and now with large-format CCD array cameras. It is currently\noperating a uniquely wide field, high-cadence program, the Zwicky Transient\nFacility (ZTF). A much larger camera for this telescope, with a 47-square-\ndegree field, started operation in 2018, as the Zwicky Transient Facility\n(ZTF). The 60-inch telescope has been roboticized, and is used to monitor\nsources discovered by sky surveys.\n\nIn the 1990s, funded mainly by the Keck Foundation, Caltech and University of\nCalifornia constructed two 10-m telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The W. M.\nKeck Observatory produced many recent discoveries in the fields of galaxy\nformation and evolution, intergalactic medium, extrasolar planets, cosmic\ngamma-ray bursts, etc. Caltech is a founding partner in the development of the\nThirty-Meter Telescope (TMT), the first of the next generation of extremely\nlarge optical/infrared telescopes.\n\nAt meter to centimeter wavelengths, Caltech operates the Owens Valley Radio\nObservatory (OVRO) in a radio-quiet location about 400 km from Pasadena, near\nBig Pine, California. Its facilities include a 40-meter telescope, a growing\n288 element long wavelength array which can image the entire sky every second,\nand a 6.1 meter telescope dedicated to observations of polarized radio\nemission from the galaxy. New radio and submm telescopes are in design and\nconstruction phases. From the 1980s until 2015, Caltech also operated the\nCaltech 10-m Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and a\nseries of millimeter interferometers, culminating in the 23-antenna Combined\nArray for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) in the Inyo Mountains.\nThese telescopes, currently being repurposed to new experiments, pioneered\nsubmm imaging and interferometry and mm wave interferometry, now carried out\nby the international Atacama Large Millimeter/submm Array (ALMA).\n\nIn Antarctica, Caltech\u2019s BICEP2 telescope, which measures the imprint of\ninflation\u2019s gravitational waves on the COSMIC microwave background, has been\nexpanded and renamed the Keck Array.\n\nOn the space observations front, Caltech hosts NASA\u2019s Spitzer Science Center\n(SSC) and IPAC, which are principal national archives for astronomy. Caltech\nscientists lead or actively participate in a number of astrophysics missions,\ncurrently including the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the NuSTAR hard X-ray\nmission. Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) are also leading the\ndevelopment of the forthcoming SPHEREx mission, that will study the early\nstages of the universe, galaxy formation, and formation of planetary systems.\nThere are numerous close connections with JPL, that designs and operates a\nnumber of NASA\u2019s scientific missions. Finally, Caltech astronomers are major\nusers of NASA\u2019s astronomical satellites, the Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra,\nFermi, Herschel, Planck, etc., ALMA and the NSF\u2019s Jansky Very Large Array\n(JVLA).\n\nCaltech is the headquarters for LIGO lab, which built and operates the world\u2019s\nmost sensitive gravitational wave observatory, the Advanced Laser\nInterferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), which in 2015 made the\nhistoric first detection of gravitational waves from a black hole binary.\nSeveral other black hole mergers have been detected since then, as well as the\nfirst gravitational wave detection of a merger of two neutron starts in 2017.\nNumerous other discoveries are expected as the operations continue.\n\n"

This fundamental\nunderstanding of the molecular basis of biological processes provides a\npowerful base for the development of applications in medicine, including\nbiotechnology and rational drug design, and in the chemical industry, where\nnucleic acids, proteins, and their analogs are now being used in the\ndevelopment of chemical systems for novel applications, and where mutagenesis\nand selection systems are used to produce novel materials.\n\n"

        "content": "Computing is a ubiquitous tool in all areas of study and research at Caltech.\nComputer science focuses on the theory and technology of computation itself:\nit is the study of information, and of the structures that communicate, store,\nand procegs information. Whether these structures are expressed in hardware\nand called machines, in software and called programs, or in nature or society,\nthe fundamental concepts are similar.\n\nStudents of the computer science option within the Computing & Mathematical\nSciences department at Caltech do not specialize along traditional lines that\ndivide hardware and software, systems and applications, or theory and\nexperiment. Rather, a unified approach to the design and analysis of computing\nstructures is taken both in courses and in research. Managing the great\ncomplexity of useful systems requires a representation of computations\namenable to both mathematical treatment and implementation. Whether the system\nis artificially designed (such as a multi-core processor), or naturally\noccurring (such as a molecule), the computer scientist formalizes the\ncomputation performed by the system and provides a systematic analysis of its\nrequirements and formal guarantees on its outcomes.\n\n##  Areas of Research\n\nResearch and advanced courses leading to the Ph.D. degree in computer science\nare concentrated in the following areas: quantum and molecular computation;\nparallel and distributed computation; theory of computation; information\ntheory; machine learning and applications; computational economics; computer\nvision; computer graphics; discrete differential geometry; networking and\npower systems. Research projects frequently involve work in several of these\nareas, with both theoretical and experimental aspects, as well as connections\nwith such fields as mathematics, physics, biology, economics, and electrical\nengineering. Crosscutting themes include:\n\n  * _Physical Implementation of Computations._ Computations must ultimately be implemented in some physical medium (e.g., semiconductor electronics, DNA self-assembly, quantum states of elementary particles, molecular electronics). Caltech has been a leader in the early development, engineering, and design of very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits. Beyond VLSI, efforts are under way to understand quantum, biomolecular, and molecular electronic substrates as possible media for future computing machines. As was the case with semiconductor electronics, Caltech computing can draw on the world-class expertise of its biology, physics, and chemistry departments as it tackles the many challenging opportunities that these new substrates present.\n  * _Robust Modeling of Physical Systems._ Caltech computer science has a unique focus in developing rigorous and robust models of the physical world. These models are mathematically and physically sound, often derived from differential geometric principles, and serve as a basis for computer graphics and vision research, as well as the simulation of mechanical, optical, and biological systems.\n  * _Systematic Design._ A key theme in the Caltech computer science option is the systematic design of systems at all levels. This theme shows up in the design of numerical algorithms for physical simulation and computer graphics, design of concurrent and distributed systems, abstractions for physical computing substrates, design of learning systems, design of programming languages, automated optimization of computations for both software and hardware implementation, as well as control and optimization of networks. The success of computer systems has allowed the building of systems of unprecedented scale and complexity. These systems can only be understood and managed if we carefully contain the complexity involved by systematically defining and exploring their design space.\n  * _Theory._ A strong theoretical understanding is the necessary foundation for systematic design, analysis, and verification. The theory of computation focuses on deep mathematical problems, many of which have substantial technological impact. Theory in computer science at Caltech includes traditional areas such as complexity algorithms, theories of numerical computation, optimization, probability, and game theory. But theory is not relegated to a single group, and has strong connections to all disciplines represented at Caltech.\n  * _Networks & Distributed Systems._ Modern networks and distributed systems are undoubtedly the most complex and critical pieces of infrastructure that the world has created. This includes communication networks as well as power networks, social networks, cloud computing, and more. The massive scale and exponential growth of such networks presents unique algorithmic, computational, and economic challenges. Research at Caltech approaches these challenges through a combination of rigorous design, systematic analysis, and interdisciplinary collaboration.\n  * _Machine Learning._ In our increasingly data-rich world, it is more important than ever to develop principled approaches that can intelligently convert raw data into actionable knowledge. At Caltech, we take a broad and integrated view of research in data-driven intelligent systems. The Decision, Optimization and Learning group brings together researchers from machine learning, optimization, applied math, statistics, control, robotics, distributed systems and human-computer interaction to form an intellectual core pertaining fundamental and applied research from statistical machine learning to statistical decision theory through optimization.\n  * _Interdisciplinary Research._ Computer simulations, modeling, and analysis are key enablers, allowing all fields of science to advance rapidly. Furthermore, insights into computational management of information helps us understand information processing issues in natural systems (from cells and neurons to financial markets and social networks) and build hypothetical models that advance our understanding of natural cognition. These relations provide many opportunities for scholars in computer science to work closely with colleagues throughout Caltech. The Information Science and Technology (IST) initiative facilitates and promotes such interdisciplinary research (see ist.caltech.edu).\n\n"

These intellectual activities\nhave a long history, and Caltech has traditionally occupied a position of\nstrength with faculty spread out across applied mathematics, electrical\nengineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, astronomy, economics, and\nmany others disciplines. In the last decade, there has been a rapid increase\nin the rate at which data are acquired, with the objective of extracting\nactionable knowledge\u2014in the form of scientific models and predictions,\nbusiness decisions, and public policies. From a technological perspective,\nthis rapid increase in the availability of data creates numerous challenges in\nacquisition, storage, and subsequent analysis. More fundamentally, humans\ncannot deal with such a volume of data directly, and it is increasingly\nessential that we automate the pipeline of information processing and\nanalysis. All areas of human endeavor are affected: science, medicine,\nengineering, manufacturing, logistics, the media, entertainment. The range of\nscenarios that concern a scientist in this domain are very broad\u2014from\nsituations in which the available data are nearly infinite (big data), to\nthose in which the data are sparse and precious; from situations in which\ncomputation is, for all practical purposes, an infinite resource to those in\nwhich it is critical to respond rapidly and computation must thus be treated\nas a precious resource; from situations in which the data are all available at\nonce to those in which they are presented as a stream.\n\nAs such, the information and data sciences now draw not just upon traditional\nareas spanning computer science, applied mathematics, and electrical\nengineering\u2014signal processing, information and communication theory, control\nand decision theory, probability and statistics, algorithms\u2014but also a range\nof new contemporary topics such as machine learning, network science,\ndistributed systems, and neuroscience. The result is an area that is new,\nfundamentally different from related areas like computer science and\nstatistics, and that is crucial to modern applications in the physical\nsciences, social sciences, and engineering.\n\nThe Information and Data Sciences (IDS) option is unabashedly mathematical,\nfocusing on the foundations of the information and data sciences, across its\nroots in probability, statistics, linear algebra, and signal processing. These\nfields all contribute crucial components of data science today. Further, it\ntakes advantage of the interdisciplinary nature of Caltech by including a\nrequired set of application courses where students will learn about how data\ntouches science and engineering broadly. The flexibility provided by this\nsequence allows students to see data science in action in biology, economics,\nchemistry, and beyond.\n\nIn addition to a major, the IDS option offers a minor that focuses on the\nmathematical foundations of the information and data sciences but recognizes\nthe fact that many students in other majors across campus have a need to\nsupplement their options with practical training in data science.\n\n"

Mechanical engineering encompasses three\nbroad areas: (1) mechanics of materials, (2) systems and control, and (3)\nthermal sciences and fluid dynamics.\n\nThe educational program in mechanical engineering prepares students for\nresearch and professional practice in an era of rapidly advancing technology.\nIt combines a strong background in the basic and engineering sciences with an\nemphasis on addressing the critical technological challenges of the day. It\nstrives to develop professional independence, creativity, leadership, and the\ncapacity for continuing professional and intellectual growth.\n\n##  Areas of Research\n\n  * _Mechanics of Materials._ Studies in the field of mechanics of materials emphasize a fundamental understanding of mechanical behavior and failure of materials as well as its applications. Areas of interest include static and dynamic deformation and failure of homogeneous and heterogeneous solids, mechanical behavior of nanostructures, active materials, microstructure characterization, and evolution, thin films, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), composites, fracture and frictional sliding of solids, earthquake source processes, seismo-mechanics, geomechanics, and granular media. Most problems emphasize bridging temporal and spatial scales and the development of advanced analytical, computational, or experimental techniques.\n  * _Systems and Control._ This area combines a broad range of mechanical engineering fields, including control systems, dynamics, kinematics, and mechanical design, as well as cross-disciplinary areas such as signal processing, computer control, engineering computation, electromechanical design, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) design, and bioengineering. General areas of interest include control theory, estimation theory, decision theory, and robotics.\n  * _Thermal Sciences and Fluid Dynamics._ This area encompasses experimental and computational research in fluid dynamics, heat and mass transfer, thermodynamics, and combustion. Specific research areas include Stokesian dynamics, granular materials, cavitation and multiphase flow, turbulent combustion, explosion dynamics, and flow-generated sound. Applications cover a range of scales from molecular to high Reynolds number flows. They include constitutive modeling of colloidal dispersions, micro/nanofluidic systems including Marangoni and thermocapillary forcing in thin liquid films, the formation of pollutants from combustion hydrocarbon fuels, instabilities of complex, reacting flows, and high-speed flows with shock waves. Inter-disciplinary activities in the group include research on geophysical phenomena, biomedical devices, bio-inspired propulsion, and the application of control theory to fluid mechanics.\n\n##  Physical Facilities\n\nStudents and faculty in mechanical engineering conduct research in laboratory\nfacilities in a number of areas, including design and prototyping, flow\nvisualization, heat transfer, robotics, bio/nano-mechanics, nano-mechanical\ntesting, seismo-mechanics, biomolecular circuits, autonomous vehicles,\nexplosion dynamics, T5 hypervelocity flow, and geomechanics. A number of High-\nPerformance Computing (HPC) clusters are available, including both CPU- and\nGPU-based architectures. Kavli Nanoscience Institute (KNI) is utilized for\nmicro- and nano-fabrication, testing, and characterization.\n\nThe Jim Hall Design Lab (The Lab) is a 5,000-square-foot machine shop and\nmaker space facility available to students, faculty, and staff of the Caltech\nCommunity. The lab facility trains students on various tools and machines\nranging from conventional manual devices, such as lathes and mills, to the\nmost modern technologies, including computer numerically controlled (CNC)\nMills, Lathes, Laser, Water Jets cutters, and 3D printers. The physical\nworkspace and its full suite of tools enable students to formulate and draft\nengineering concepts using computer-aided design (CAD) software and assemble\nactual working prototypes from metals, plastics, and the latest in high-\nstrength composites. As engineers in training, our students' lab experience\nprovides a \"hands-on\" aspect to their educational background, complementing\ntheir foundational engineering coursework. The mission of our lab facility is\nto enable our students to gain valuable technical and project management\nexperience and prepare them for the next phase of their careers.\n\nThe undergraduate lab facility is a state-of-the-art, 950-square-foot teaching\nlaboratory located in the Gates-Thomas building.

The lab facility also\nincludes a 20 cm x 2cm x 2m water tunnel with an integrated laser particle\nimage velocimetry (PIV) system for full-field visualization of 2D velocity\nflow fields. The primary mission of this lab facility is to support the\nExperiments and Modeling in Mechanical Engineering (ME50 ab) course sequence,\nwhich is offered each year during the winter and spring quarters. ME50a, taken\nduring the winter term, introduces our students to Computational Fluid\nDynamics (CFD) and experimental fluid mechanics. ME50 b, taken during the\nspring term, introduces our students to Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of\nengineering structures and experimental solid mechanics. Students gain hands-\non experience in both parts of the course sequence as they work through each\nphase of a lab experiment, data collection, and post-processing of the\nexperimental through Matlab. Technical writing skills are also reinforced\nthrough individual reports that students must independently draft and submit\nfor each modeling assignment and lab project.\n\n"

        "content": "Understanding the brain remains one of the great intellectual challenges for\nscience. To grasp the function of this marvelous organ, one needs to\ninvestigate structures, mechanisms, and dynamics that span across many spatial\nand temporal scales. For example, when we hear a sound, our brain is sensitive\nto time delays of just a few microseconds, yet the memory of that sound can\nlast a lifetime\u201411 orders of magnitude longer. The span is similar in the\nspatial domain. The sheer number of nerve cells in the brain, approximately\n1,011, suggests a coarse-grained treatment that glosses over the details of\nthe individual neurons, yet a single nerve cell and even a single molecule can\nplay a decisive role. For example, activation of a single light receptor in\nour eye leads to a visual percept that can ultimately direct our behavior.\n\nNeurobiology at Caltech does, indeed, span this range. Our laboratories work\non the molecular structure and function of channels and receptors; the\nintegration of such molecules into signaling organelles like the synapse; the\nstructure and function of single neurons; the integration of neurons of\ndiverse types into circuits; and the collective function of these circuits in\ncontrolling behavior, perception, memory, action, cognition, and emotion.\nAnother area of emphasis concerns the developmental mechanisms by which these\nstructures form: the differentiation of neurons in early life, the genetic\nmechanisms that guide their synaptic wiring plan, and how subsequent\nexperience modifies these connections. There is also increasing interest in\nleveraging the basic neurobiological insights to an understanding of brain\ndisorders. Finally, Caltech\u2019s traditional strength in engineering stimulates\nthe development of new methods for brain science: from optical techniques to\nnew twists of genetic engineering, to novel multi-electrode devices, to\ncomputational models and theories.\n\nTo further explore the range of brain research at Caltech\u2014and enjoy some\ncolorful pictures\u2014please visit the neurobiology option website.\n\n"

The\nissues facing our students in the future will be different from those that are\ncurrent, but the analytical principles and methodology needed to understand\nthose problems will likely remain the same, albeit improved. Thus, the social\nscience core curriculum provides students with the knowledge and tools to, in\nthe words of the catalog, \u201cnavigate the societal, political, and economic\nfactors that influence, and are influenced by, their work.\u201d\n\nThe objectives of the social science core curriculum can be broken into three\nbroad categories of courses: introductory courses that teach basic principles;\nmethods courses that seek to transmit skills and analytical tools; and courses\nexposing students to substantive ideas and problems in the social sciences.\nMore concretely: \u201cFundamental ideas and principles\u201d classes expose students to\na broad and introductory overview of basic ideas in economics, psychology, and\npolitical science. \u201cMethodology and analysis\u201d courses focus on giving students\nthe theoretical, empirical, and data science tools to analyze problems. They\ncover the theoretical modeling tools most commonly used in the social\nsciences, as well as statistical and econometric techniques that are needed to\nanalyze data. \u201cSubstantive problems in social science: Individuals,\ninstitutions, and markets\u201d courses expose students to an array of substantive\nquestions in social science, from resource allocation via markets and prices,\nthe workings of political institutions, the consequences of poor governance,\nthe psychological basis of human behavior, and an understanding of financial\nmarkets.\n\n##  SOCIAL SCIENCE GRADUATE PROGRAM\n\nThe Caltech Ph.D. program in Social Science is highly interdisciplinary,\nintegrating economics, political science, quantitative history, econometrics,\nand finance. It makes extensive use of mathematical modeling, laboratory\nexperiments, and econometric techniques. Research in the social sciences\nprogram at Caltech strongly emphasizes the understanding and analysis of the\nrelationships between individual incentives, collective behavior, political\nand economic institutions, and public policy.\n\n##  Areas of Research\n\n  * Experimental Economics and Experimental Political Science. Caltech social scientists were among the early pioneers in the field of laboratory experimentation and Caltech has maintained a strong leadership position and research presence in the field ever since. Examples of the kinds of laboratory studies the faculty are engaged in include the behavior and design of auctions and market-like mechanisms, public goods provision and related topics in public economics, the economics of networks and matching, decision theory, inter-personal bargaining, behavioral economics, committee decision making, and electoral competition. Many of our faculty engage in laboratory experimentation as part of their research agendas in economics and political science (Agranov, Camerer, Nielsen, Palfrey, Rangel, Saito, Sprenger). A special strength of Caltech is that economic and financial theorists join in colaborations to use laboratory control in order to experimentally test theories that are otherwise difficult to test conclusively using field data (Cvitanic, Saito, Tamuz). Many of these experiments are conducted through the use of net-worked computers (see Facilities) in the William D. Hacker Social Science Experimental Laboratory (SSEL) and the Laboratory for Experimental Economics and Political Science (LEEPS). The real world provides another setting for experimental research outside the laboratory, and Caltech social scientists have conducted field experiments involving a wide variety of topics, ranging from decision making in organizations, social networks, and the behavior of different cultural groups.\n  * Economic Theory and Game Theory. Caltech has a strong research group in economic theory, which, together with rigorous training in statistics and econometrics forms the backbone of the core curriculum for the PhD program. Theoretical research at Caltech has played a key role in the design and practical implementation of new institutions that more efficiently allocate scarce resources and provide public goods. Some of this work has had important public policy applications. Prominent examples include the design of FCC auctions to allocate the electromagnetic spectrum for telecommunication, and the market for allocating and trading permits for pollution emissions in the Los Angeles basin. Much of this theoretical design research is complemented by experimental studies that provide a testbed for competing designs. There is an active group of faculty and graduate students working in the areas of the optimal design of contracts and markets (Cvitanic), the economics of information (Pomatto, Tamuz), decision theory (Caradonna, Pomatto, Rangel, Saito), game theory (Niemeyer, Palfrey, Pomatto, Saito, Tamuz) and matching Social Science and Research. There are several active programs for inter-action between our theory faculty in the social sciences and the faculties of computer science and applied mathematics. This is formally organized around two interdisciplinary centers, the Lee Center for Advanced Networking and the Social and Information Science Laboratory (SISL), with the latter offering a bi-weekly seminar coordinated between the computer science department and the social sciences faculty and featuring speakers in economics, computer science, game theory and related disciplines. There are many informal connections that reinforce the formal connections, including research collaborations between faculty and graduate students in these different areas.\n  * Political Economy and Political Science. Caltech has a long tradition of strength in research that spans the boundary of the economics and political science disciplines. Research in political economy at Caltech continues to be a major strength of the program and provides a natural bridge that unites the faculty in economics, political science, and quantitative history. The focus of research in political economy and political science at Caltech emphasizes rigorous theoretical modeling drawing heavily upon techniques from economic theory and game theory, combined with empirical studies using highly sophisticated quantitative analyses of a wide variety of data sources: experimental, survey, field, voting, and historical data. Ongoing political economy research areas of the current faculty include: the interacting forces of bargaining, voting, and communication in committees, legislatures, bureaucracies, and assemblies (Agranov, Gibilisco, Hirsch, Katz, Lopez-Moctezuma, Palfrey); the Voting Technology Project, a joint Caltech-MIT research venture, established in 2000 to evaluate and improve the performance and reliability of U.S. balloting technology, registration systems, election administration, redistricting, and election law (Alvarez, Katz); political forces affecting judicial behavior (Hirsch), strategic voting in multi-candidate and multi-stage elections (Alvarez, Kiewiet, Palfrey), the politics of inequality and redistribution (Agranov, Palfrey) and several areas of comparative and international politics, including studies of the causes and consequences of corruption, domestic unrest, and international conflict (Gibilisco, Lopez-Moctezuma).\n  * Financial Economics. Caltech has built a small but very active research group in finance. The researchers in this group are working on a range of topics in mathematical finance, asset pricing and dynamic contracting (Cvitanic), behavioral finance (Camerer) and economic history of financial crises (Janas, Rosenthal). There is a regular seminar series in finance that features distinguished researchers from around the world. Caltech faculty outside the finance group itself are also engaged in empirical research in financial economics. These include experimental areas of study and research studies of asset markets (Camerer), interest rate policy making by the Federal Open Market Committee (Lopez-Moctezuma), and online credit markets (Xin).\n  * Behavioral Economics. Research in behavioral economics at Caltech overlaps all of the above groups. Laboratory experimental research discovers interesting behavioral anomalies and can also test theoretical models designed to account for such anomalies. On the theoretical side, much of the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic research at Caltech is motivated by experimental observations, leading to extensions or modifications of standard models. These extensions in turn suggest experimental designs that are then implemented in the laboratory by our faculty and graduate students. Faculty research in political behavior (Alvarez, Katz, Kiewiet) and behavioral finance (Camerer) are complementary and add strength more generally to understanding social behavior. We also have on our faculty a small but very active group conducting research at the boundary of biology, psychology, and the social sciences (Adolphs, Camerer, Mobbs, O\u2019Doherty, Rangel). This group offers a separate PhD option focused on the behavioral neuroscience of decision making (see the catalog entry for \u201cSocial and Decision Neuroscience\u201d). Utilizing fMRI brain-imaging, eye-tracking, and other biological measurement technologies, this group, often in collaboration with other social science faculty and graduate students, has begun to explore the neural foundations of decision making in individual choice, game theoretic, and market settings.\n  * Quantitative History. Just as with the theoretical, experimental, and empirical work using contemporary data, historical research conducted at Caltech employs mathematical modeling and sophisticated statistical techniques to attack a wide range of historical questions. Historical research conducted at Caltech addresses questions that cut across economics, political science, political economy, and finance, often combining archival work with state-of-the art statistical techniques. These include the development of capital and credit markets (Janas, Rosenthal), the evolution of wealth distribution from 1800 to the present (Rosenthal), the causes of recurrent financial crises in capitalist economies (Janas, Rosenthal), the determinants of economic and technological growth, the development of and financing for public institutions (Dennison, Janas), and the roots of the divergence between east and west Europe (Dennison).\n  * Applied microeconomics and econometrics. Empirical research in social science blends creative collection and analysis of field data with rigorous application of tools and methods from econometrics and statistics. We offer courses and supervise students in these areas. A number of faculty members specialize in empirical work in a number of fields, including finance (Xin), industrial organization (Xin), political economy (Alvarez, Gibilisco, Katz, Kiewiet, Lopez-Moctezuma, Sherman), and behavioral economics (Camerer). Methodological areas of specialization include econometrics (Sherman, Xin), causal inference (Alvarez, Katz, Sherman), machine learning (Alvarez, Camerer, Katz, Xin), and Bayesian statistics (Katz).  \n\n##  Physical Facilities\n\nCaltech has two state-of-the-art onsite laboratories for experimental research\nin economics, political science, game theory, decision theory, and financial\neconomics: The Laboratory for Experimental Economics and Political Science\n(LEEPS, established 1987) and The Hacker Social Science Experimental\nLaboratory (SSEL, established 1998).\n\n"

To be\nconsidered for admission, applications to the first-year class must be\nsubmitted online by November 1 for Restrictive Early Action or January 3 for\nRegular Decision.\n\n##  QuestBridge\n\nSince 2008, Caltech has been a proud QuestBridge partner school. QuestBridge\npartners with approximately 50 institutions to connect the nation\u2019s brightest\nstudents from low-income backgrounds with leading institutions of higher\neducation where they are given a full ride with no loan. Applications are due\nto QuestBridge annually at the end of September. Students are able to rank\nCaltech as one of fifteen institutions they\u2019d like to attend and, if chosen as\na QuestBridge Match Finalist, Caltech reviews student applications in November\nand matches with QuestBridge Match students on December 1 each year. For more\ninformation about QuestBridge, visit\n[www.questbridge.org](https://www.questbridge.org/).\n\n##  Restrictive Early Action\n\nRestrictive Early Action is a non-binding option that limits the number of\nschools an applicant may apply to during the early period, but in return\noffers a student the opportunity to receive an offer of admission from their\nfirst-choice school. The Restrictive Early Action process requires that the\ncompleted application be submitted online by November 1 through the Common\nApp. Under this application plan, students will be notified in mid-December of\ntheir admission decision. Students admitted under Restrictive Early Action\nhave until May 1 to make their commitment to attend.\n\nStudents who choose to apply REA to Caltech may not apply Early Action nor\nEarly Decision to any other institution, with the following exceptions:\n\n  * An institution outside of the United States;\n  * Any public institution that has a non-binding admissions policy with a fall application deadline (such as the University of California system);\n  * An institution's non-binding rolling admissions process;\n  * Any military academy;\n  * Any scholarships or special academic programs with an early deadline at another institution, public or private, if the early application submission is a necessary aspect for consideration, and the outcome is non-binding;\n  * If you are deferred admission after applying REA to Caltech, you may apply to another institution's Early Decision II program. If you are admitted to that institution's Early Decision II program, you are required to withdraw your application of admission to Caltech.\n\n##  Academic Requirements\n\nStudents are expected to prepare for Caltech by successfully completing the\nfollowing curriculum:\n\n  * Four years of math, including one year of calculus*\n  * One year of physics*\n  * One year of chemistry*\n  * One year of biology (recommended)\n  * Four years of English\n  * Two years of history and/or social sciences courses (3+ years recommended)\n\nIf a student is unable to take a calculus, chemistry, or physics course in\nhigh school because it was not available to them or they experienced\nunresolvable course conflicts, Caltech will accept examination scores or\ncertification showing proof of knowledge in the subject in lieu of an academic\ncourse requirement, provided both the student and their counselor document the\nunderlying, unresolvable issue(s).\n\nThe following examinations and certificates can substitute for the course\nrequirements for calculus, chemistry, or physics:\n\n  * A score of 5 on AP exams in AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Chemistry, AP Physics 1, AP Physics 2, or AP Physics C\n  * A score of 6 or 7 on the IB Mathematics HL; Chemistry SL or HL; or Physics SL or HL examinations. **Note, IB Mathematics SL does not meet our requirements.**\n  * A certification from Schoolhouse.world in one of the following courses: AP/College Calculus AB or BC; AP/College Chemistry; High School Physics or AP/College Physics 1\n\n**For the class of 2029, these are the only avenues for substituting course\nrequirements in calculus, chemistry, and/or physics at Caltech.** There will\nbe no exceptions.\n\n###  Standardized Exams\n\nBeginning with Fall 2025 entry, Caltech will require first-year applicants to\nsubmit either the SAT or ACT for admission to Caltech. The writing section of\nthe ACT is not required.\n\nFor more information on the standardized testing policy, visit the UGA\nStandardized Testing page.\n\nSAT Subject Tests: As of January 2020, Caltech eliminated the requirement for\napplicants to submit two SAT Subject Tests. These sections will not be\nconsidered in the application review process.\n\nEnglish Proficiency Scores are required of all international students unless\n1) the student's native language is English or 2) English is the primary\nlanguage of instruction in the student's secondary school.\n\nAcceptable English proficiency exams include:\n\n  * TOEFL Internet Based Test (IBT)\n  * IELTS\n  * Duolingo English Test (DET)\n\n###  Essays\n\nThe essays, which are required as a part of the application, are intended to\nprovide students the opportunity to communicate their interests, experiences,\nand background. Since Caltech is interested in learning about each applicant,\nthe essays are viewed as an important part of the admission decision process.\nCaltech's supplemental essays are updated annually and listed on the\nadmissions website each August 1.\n\n###  Letters of Recommendation\n\nTwo letters of recommendation and a Secondary School Report are required. One\nletter must be from a STEM teacher (math, chemistry, physics, or biology), and\none letter from a humanities or social science teacher (English, history,\ngovernment, or economics). A Secondary School Report must be filled out by the\napplicant\u2019s secondary school counselor or other school official.\n\n###  Additional Materials\n\nStudents are welcome to provide supplemental materials that they believe will\nhelp the admissions committee learn more about them. These materials may\ninclude but are not limited to:\n\n  * Research paper, abstract, or publication (citation if published, letter of evaluation, and research description required)\n  * Maker portfolio\n  * Visual art\n  * Description of an internship\n\nAfter the application deadline, students will receive a link to the Caltech\napplication portal (Beaver Breakroom), which will include [instructions on\nsubmitting supplemental materials](https://apply.caltech.edu/portal/portfolio-\ninstructions).\n\n###  Acceptance\n\nCaltech is a member of the National Association for College Admissions\nCounseling and therefore agrees to comply with the national candidate\u2019s reply\ndate of May 1. Places in the entering class will not be held after May 1.\nRestrictive Early Action applicants will be informed of their admissions\ndecision in mid-December and Regular Decision applicants will be informed by\nmid-March. Regardless of round, admitted students have until May 1 to respond\nto their admissions offer.\n\n###  Gap Year\n\nCaltech will consider requests from admitted students for a one-year gap year\n(and occasionally two-year gap years in the case of students on religious\nmissions or doing required military service). Students who request a gap year\nmust accept their offer of admission and then submit a written request stating\nthe purpose of postponement to the Director of Undergraduate Admissions.\nInstructions are provided to admitted students annually in the Caltech\napplicant portal, called the Beaver Breakroom.\n\n###  Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and College Credit\n\nCaltech encourages all prospective undergraduate applicants to prepare by\nchallenging themselves with the most rigorous course of study available,\nincluding the Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB)\nprograms. However, college credit for AP or IB classes is not automatic.\nCourse credit and/or placement in an accelerated program is sometimes granted\nas deemed appropriate by the department faculty. The awarding of Caltech\ncourse credit takes place at the time of registration each fall.\n\n####  Biology\n\nBiology majors who have passed Bi 8 and Bi 9 (with 9 units on grades) are\nconsidered to have met the core requirement of Bi 1.\n\n####  Chemistry\n\nThe student\u2019s qualifications for placing out of Ch 1 ab will only be\ndetermined by the performance on a placement examination to be administered in\nthe summer prior to registration. Qualified students, with the instructor\u2019s\nconsent, are allowed to substitute either Ch 8 or Ch/ChE 9 for the \u201dcore\u201d\nchemistry laboratory requirement (Ch 3 a or Ch 3 x).\n\n####  English/Writing\n\nAll incoming students (first-year and transfers) will take a placement\nassessment to determine whether they are adequately prepared for the\nsubstantial writing component that is part of all first-year humanities\ncourses. Most new students participate in a web-based version of this\nassessment, which is usually conducted in early June. A makeup assessment is\nheld just before fall classes begin. Based on results of this writing\nassessment, students may be required to take Wr 1 or Wr 2 in the fall quarter.\n(Wr 1 and Wr 2 count for general Institute credit only.) After completing\nthese courses, students may, at the discretion of humanities faculty, be\nrequired to go on to subsequent coursework in academic writing, such as Wr 3,\nWr 4, or Wr 50, before or concurrently with first-year humanities coursework.\nDuring the first week of classes, students will be required to produce an in-\nclass writing sample to confirm the initial placement.\n\n####  Mathematics\n\nDuring the summer before the first year, entering first-year students are\nasked to take a diagnostic exam in basic calculus that will determine which\nstudents will be placed in a special section of Ma 1 a for those with less\ncomplete preparation, and later take Ma 1 d; and if they are interested in\nadvanced placement, they may also take an examination to determine whether\nthey will begin the mathematics core sequence at an advanced level.\n\nNormally, an entering first-year student takes Ma 1 abc, Calculus of One and\nSeveral Variables and Linear Algebra. This course covers the calculus of\nfunctions of one and several variables; infinite series; vector algebra; basic\nand advanced linear algebra; derivatives of vector functions, multiple\nintegrals, line and path integrals; and theorems of Green and Stokes. The\ncourse is divided into a lecture part and a recitation part that focuses\nmainly on problem-solving.\n\nStudents in need of additional problem-solving practice may be advised to take\nMa 8 (in addition to Ma 1 a) in the first quarter.\n\n####  Physics\n\nThe required first-year physics course, Ph 1 abc, is considerably more\nrigorous than most advanced placement work, and entering first-year students\nare encouraged to take Ph 1. A test is administered during the summer to aid\nin the organization of Ph 1; students who have performed particularly well can\ndiscuss the possibilities for advanced placement with the physics\nrepresentative during orientation.  \nA second test may then be required.\n\n###  Residency Expectation\n\nUndergraduate housing includes the eight houses (Avery, Blacker, Dabney,\nFleming, Lloyd, Page, Ricketts, Venerable), and the Bechtel Residence and\nMarks House and Braun House. First- and second-year students are required to\nlive on campus. Requests for exceptions to this requirement should be\nsubmitted to the Office of Student Experience, and must be approved by the\nDean of Undergraduate Students and the Vice President for Student Affairs.\n\n###  New Student Orientation\n\nAll first-year, transfer, 3/2 and exchange students are expected to attend the\nNew Student Orientation as part of the regular registration procedure.\nOrientation takes place the week prior to the beginning of classes. Faculty\nmembers, staff and upperclass student leaders participate help to introduce\nnew students to the Caltech community. The orientation period provides an\nopportunity for new students to become acquainted with the campus, the Honor\nSystem, and other aspects of life at Caltech. In addition, they will meet\nclassmates, upperclass students, and faculty during this time\n\n"

We require a\ncompleted application, letters of recommendation, an official transcript from\nthe last secondary school attended and all colleges or universities attended,\ndescriptions of all college-level math and science courses, and completion of\nthe Caltech Transfer Entrance Examinations. Please review the section titled\n\u201dEligibility Criteria for Admission\u2019\u2019 to determine whether you meet the\neligibility requirements for transfer admissions consideration.\n\n###  Academic Preparation\n\nThe following is a list of the Caltech core curriculum, taken by all Caltech\nstudents during their first two years. It is expected that transfer students\nwill have had exposure to mathematics and science courses on a comparable\nlevel prior to entry to Caltech. Any of the following core courses that have\nnot been covered by incoming transfer students must be taken upon\nmatriculation to Caltech. There are no specific topics expected to have been\ncovered in humanities and social science classes.\n\nAn evaluation of each transfer student\u2019s written English is required prior to\nregistration and may result in an additional course requirement.\n\nFirst-year courses:\n\n  * Mathematics 1 abc\n  * Physics 1 abc\n  * Chemistry 1 ab\n  * Chemistry 3 a or 3 x\n  * Computer Science 1\n  * Biology 1, 1 x, 8, or 9\n  * Humanities and Social Science electives\n  * Menu science class (see [Menu Classes](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/information-for-undergraduate-students/graduation-requirements-all-options/core-institute-requirements-all-options/#menu-classes); can be taken first-year or sophomore year)\n\nSophomore courses:\n\n  * Physics 2 abc or Physics 12 abc\n  * Additional laboratory science\n  * Humanities and Social Science electives\n\n  \nNote: Mathematics 3 is not required for the core curriculum, but may be\nrequired for a specific option.]\n\n###  Eligibility Criteria for Admission\n\nThe Institute admits to its sophomore and junior classes a small number of\nstudents who have excellent records at other institutions of collegiate rank\nand who perform satisfactorily on the Caltech Transfer Admissions Entrance\nExaminations.\n\n  * Students must have completed their secondary school  \neducation, and have subsequently enrolled at a college or  \nuniversity and earned credit, in order to be considered for  \ntransfer admission.\n\n  * Transfer students are not admitted to the senior year at Caltech.\n  * Students who have already completed a bachelor\u2019s degree in any subject are not eligible for transfer.\n\n###  Standardized Test Requirements\n\nTransfer applicants are not required to submit SAT scores and, during the\ntesting moratorium through Fall 2025, Caltech will not review any SAT or ACT\ntest scores in the admissions process.\n\n###  International Student English Proficiency\n\nEnglish Proficiency Scores are required of all international students unless\n1) the student's native language is English or 2) English is the primary\nlanguage of instruction in the student's secondary school and university.\n\nAcceptable English proficiency exams include:\n\n  * TOEFL Internet Based Test (IBT)\n  * IELTS\n  * Duolingo English Test (DET)\n\n###  Evaluation of Written English\n\nAll entering transfer students will be required to undergo an evaluation of\ntheir written English prior to enrolling.\n\n###  Transfer Admissions Entrance Examinations\n\nAll applicants are required to take Caltech Transfer Admissions Entrance\nExaminations in mathematics and physics. After a student submits their\n[transfer application](https://www.scoir.com/students/apply-with-scoir) and\nafter the February 1 deadline, the student will complete the Entrance\nExamination Self-Proctor Form through the Caltech applicant portal (called the\nBeaver Breakroom). Once the student submits this form, Caltech will send the\nstudent the exams electronically, along with instructions for uploading\ncompleted work.\n\nStudents may take the exams on their honor, adhering to Caltech's Honor Code:\nNo member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other\nmember of the Caltech community.\n\nThe examinations are due [February\n15](https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/apply/transfer-applicants/transfer-\ndeadlines).\n\nHere are some more specifics:\n\n  * Each exam has a 4-hour time limit, for a total of an 8-hour commitment. Students are not required to take both exams in one day.\n  * Students may only look at the examinations at the time that they take them.\n  * Reference materials, calculators, electronic devices, textbooks, tablets, notes, or aids are not permitted.\n  * If a student requires special testing accommodations, please let us know prior to the application deadline.\n\nCheating on the examinations only hurts the student and their ability to be\nsuccessful at Caltech. [The Caltech curriculum is extraordinarily challenging\nby design](https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/why-caltech/academics). Don't\ncheat.\n\n###  Transfer of Credit\n\nThe courses for which enrolled transfer students will receive credit, and the\ncorresponding class standing, will be determined at the time of enrollment.\nFinal transcripts must be submitted to Undergraduate Admissions. Syllabi must\nbe submitted to the Registrar, who will present the material to the faculty\nfor evaluation. After a student is admitted, they may work with Admissions to\nobtain a preliminary evaluation of class standing. Preliminary class standings\nare not guaranteed. Actual class standing will be based upon the formal\ntransfer credit evaluations over the summer. If the standard of work taken\nelsewhere is uncertain, additional examinations may be required before the\nquestion of credit is finally determined. Once a student has enrolled, faculty\nmembers review each course submitted for credit on an individual basis.\nTherefore, we cannot answer questions about the acceptance of coursework from\nother institutions prior to admission.\n\n###  Graduation Requirements\n\nAdmitted transfer students must meet the following requirements in order to\nreceive a Caltech Bachelor of Science degree.\n\n  * A Caltech undergraduate degree is based on a four-year residential experience (study abroad included) in which students have the time to explore their academic interests in a deep and rigorous way. Students who are admitted as transfer students or 3/2 students may be granted advanced standing and term credit for academic work accepted in transfer to Caltech. However, transfer and 3/2 students must enroll for a minimum of six terms at Caltech. Any exceptions must be approved by the dean of undergraduate students and the vice president for student affairs.\n  * Regardless of the amount of credit awarded upon matriculation, transfer students must spend at least two years (six terms) in residence at Caltech. Students must also earn at least 216 units at Caltech, not including courses taken to satisfy math and science core curriculum requirements.\n  * Students must take, or have taken the equivalent of, all core curriculum courses.\n  * Students must satisfy all of their chosen option\u2019s degree requirements. Transfer students may choose from among all Caltech undergraduate options.\n\n###  Admissions Application\n\nApplications are available by December 1. Completed applications should be\nreceived by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by February 1.

        "content": "##  Procedures\n\nStudents must register on the dates specified in the academic calendar.\nStudents are not registered until they have both\n\n  * enrolled in an approved list of courses, _and_\n  * are current with the Bursar\u2019s Office. All undergraduate students with an outstanding Bursar\u2019s bill balance of $300 or more and graduate students with a Bursar\u2019s bill balance of $1,500 or more will have a hold placed on their registration for the subsequent quarter the day before online registration opens. The hold will be released once students have paid their bill in full or worked out a satisfactory payment plan with the Bursar\u2019s Office.\n\nAny student who has not completed both parts of registration within one week\nafter the first day of classes will be removed from the Institute rolls. A\nstudent on leave from, or not registered with, the Institute may not attend\nclasses, live in Institute housing, participate in Institute programs, use\nInstitute facilities, work on campus, or use student services such as Wellness\nServices, Center for Inclusion & Diversity,\n\nCareer Achievement, Leadership, and Exploration (CALE), or the Hixon Writing\nCenter during the leave, unless approved in writing by the Dean of Students or\ndesignee. The Institute can place a hold on a student\u2019s registration in a\nvariety of circumstances including any failure to comply with Institute\nrequirements.\n\nStudents are required to maintain continuity of registration until the\nrequirements for the Bachelor of Science degree are fulfilled, except in the\ncase of an approved undergraduate student leave.\n\n##  Changes in Registration\n\nAll changes in registration must be reported to the Registrar\u2019s Office by the\nstudent prior to the published deadlines. A grade of F will be given in any\ncourse for which a student registers and which they do not either complete\nsatisfactorily or drop. A course is considered dropped when a student drops\nthe course in REGIS or notifies the Registrar\u2019s Office in writing. A student\nmay not at any time withdraw from a course that is required for graduation in\ntheir option, without permission of the registrar.\n\nA student may not add a course after the last day for adding courses, or\nwithdraw from a course after the last date for dropping courses, without the\napproval of the Undergraduate Academic Standards and Honors (UASH) Committee.\nIn cases where the late addition of a course would have put the student in a\nposition of overload by Add Day of the term concerned, the student must also\nobtain an approved retroactive overload from the dean or associate dean of\nundergraduate students. Registration for added courses is complete when a\nstudent registers for the course on REGIS or sends a written request to the\nRegistrar\u2019s Office with the proper approvals. No credit will be given for a\ncourse for which a student has not properly registered. The responsibility for\nregistering or dropping courses (in REGIS or by direct communication with the\nRegistrar\u2019s Office) is on the student. Failure to fulfill the responsibility\nbecause of oversight or ignorance is not sufficient grounds to petition for\npermission to drop or add courses after the deadline.\n\n###  Humanities Drop Policy\n\nStudents who do not attend the first class of the term will be automatically\ndropped from the class. Students who notify the instructor in advance of their\ninability to attend the first class may remain enrolled in the class at the\ninstructor\u2019s discretion.\n\n###  Academic Advisement\n\nStudents will be assigned first-year advisers, and later option advisers, who\nwill guide students to resources about the curriculum, graduation\nrequirements, and Institute policies and procedures. Through the academic\nadvising experiences at Caltech, students will develop an educational plan for\nsuccessfully achieving their goals and select courses each quarter to progress\ntoward fulfilling that educational plan. Undergraduate students are required\nto meet with their adviser at least once a year. Failure to meet at least once\nprior to the start of spring term will result in a hold placed on the\nstudent\u2019s record which will prevent them from registering online.\n\n###  Summer Research or Summer Reading\n\nQualified undergraduate students who are regular students at the Institute are\npermitted to engage in research or reading during the summer, but in order to\nreceive academic credit the student must have the approval of their division\nand must complete the registration process for such summer work before June 1.\nAny requests to add research after June 1 must be submitted as a Late Add\npetition to the Undergraduate Academic Standards and Honors Committee (UASH)\nas well as be approved by the Division Chair. An undergraduate may not receive\npayment for research carried out for academic credit. Students who are\nregistered for summer research or reading will not be required to pay tuition\nfor the units. A student may apply up to 18 units of summer research per\nsummer and 36 units in total toward Institute graduation requirements.\n\n##  UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT LEAVES OF ABSENCE\n\n###  General Information\n\nFormal separation from the Institute is effected by filing a completed\n[undergraduate student leave form](https://deans.caltech.edu/leaves-\nabsence/undergraduate-student-leave-form) to be for\u00adwarded to the registrar\nand other appropriate offices. The effective date of a withdrawal is entered\nby the undergraduate dean or designee. A student withdrawing from the\nInstitute at any time during the term without filing a formal undergraduate\nleave form will not be considered withdrawn. In such a case, any grades\nreported by the instructors will be recorded on the official transcript, and\nthe grade of F will be recorded for all other courses.\n\nA student who withdraws or is absent for a term (or longer), without an\napproved undergraduate student leave must petition for reinstatement to return\nto the Institute. Reinstatement rules are listed under scholastic\nrequirements. Return from involuntary, medical and/or personal leave requires\napproval through the Undergraduate Deans' office.\n\nIf the withdrawal occurs after Add Day of any term, a W (standing for\n\"withdrawn\") will be recorded on the student's transcript for all courses in\nwhich the stu\u00addent is enrolled. A grade of W is not included in the\ncomputation of the student's grade-point average. The record will also\nindicate wheth\u00ader an undergraduate student leave was granted.\n\nCaltech considers students on an approved leave to be matriculated; however,\nstudents on leave for any reason are not currently enrolled and therefore do\nnot enjoy all the rights and privileges of enrolled students. Unenrolled\nstudents, and accordingly, students on leave, have limited access to Caltech's\neducational activities, programs, and services. In some cases, the dean or\ndesignee may also require that unenrolled students apply for permission in\nadvance of visiting campus.\n\nStudents on leave should only be on campus as an occasional visitor. Students\non leave may not attend classes or labs, live in Institute housing, retain\nleadership positions, or access certain student resources, including Student\nWellness Services or Residential Experience activities or programs during\ntheir leave.\n\nThey also may not obtain employment or do volunteer work on campus unless they\nhave been given permission to do so via an approved \u201cPermission to Participate\nwhile on Leave\u201d Form: <https://deansoffice.wufoo.com/forms/request-to-\nparticipate-while-on-leave/>. Failure to gain a dean\u2019s permission to be active\non campus will be considered when a student on any type of leave applies to\nreturn.\n\nCareer Achievement, Leadership and Exploration (CALE) is, by default, open to\nall students who have not been permanently separated from the Institute,\nregardless of leave or enrollment status, unless otherwise revoked by the\nDirector of CALE or the deans' office.\n\nStudents may consult with their advisor and otherwise plan for their academic\nfuture; however, they will not receive credit for courses unless they are\nproperly enrolled. Students who are on leave are still subject to all\nInstitute policies, including the Institute Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct\nPolicy. Violations of policy while on leave may affect a student's eligibility\nto re-enroll.\n\n###  Voluntary Leaves\n\n####  Personal Leaves\n\nA student may request a voluntary leave of absence for personal reasons\n(personal leave) by submitting a written petition via completion of the\n[undergraduate student leave form](https://deans.caltech.edu/leaves-\nabsence/undergraduate-student-leave-form). International students should\nconsult with the International Student Programs Office regarding visa\nimplications prior to submitting the leave petition.\n\nThe deans may grant a personal leave provided (a) the student is in good\nstanding, in other words does not have to meet special academic or\ndisciplinary requirements as a result of reinstatement, (b) the leave is for\none year or less, although special circumstances can be considered for a\nlonger leave, and (c) the leave extends over a period that includes at least\none full term. Leaves will not be granted retroactively and must be filed by\nthe last day of classes of the term.\n\nStudents who elect to take a personal leave while involved in pending conduct\nprocesses will be expected to participate in the pending conduct process until\nits completion. However, the Deans\u2019 Office may excuse students from\nparticipation while on personal leave if extenuating circumstances justify the\npause.\n\n[A petition to return from a personal\nleave](https://deansoffice.wufoo.com/forms/undergraduate-student-return-from-\nleave-form/) should be submitted six (6) weeks before the first day of the\nterm for which the student intends to return. Return from a personal leave is\nsubject to the approval of the Deans' Office.\n\n####  Medical Leaves\n\nIf a student is unable to complete their coursework due to medical reasons,\nthe student may petition for a medical leave of absence by submitting a\nwritten petition via completion of the [undergraduate student leave\nform](https://deans.caltech.edu/leaves-absence/undergraduate-student-leave-\nform). International students should consult with the International Student\nPrograms Office regarding visa implications prior to submitting the medical\nleave petition.\n\nThe duration of a medical leave should be determined primarily by the\nstudent's improvement in treatment. In general, however, medical leaves are\nexpected to include at least one full term.  \n\nThe Institute may impose conditions on return from a medical leave, which may\ninclude confirmation from the student's health care provider that the student\nis following the recommended course of treatment, the student's consent for\nthe provider to discuss the student's condition or progress during the leave\nwith Caltech officials, including representatives of Student Wellness Services\nand the Deans' Office, and an independent evaluation of the student's\nreadiness to return by a qualified medical professional. Any conditions of\nreturn will be specified at the time of the leave approval.\n\nTo request a leave, a student can take the following steps:\n\n  1. Submit the leave form.\n  2. The student should then meet with either:\n\n* The Medical Director of Health Services or designee (for leaves related to medical conditions), or\n\n* The Clinical Director of Counseling Services or designee (for leaves related to emotional, psychological, or psychiatric conditions).\n\nThis meeting is to help the student make plans for their treatment during\ntheir leave, to discuss the need for any conditions placed on the leave, and\nto answer any questions the student has about the leave process. After this\nmeeting, the student should give written consent for the Director to\ncommunicate their recommendation to the Deans' Office by filling out the\nrelease of information and records consent form available on the Student\nWellness website.\n\n  1. The Dean or designee may then authorize the medical leave.\n  2. If a student taking medical leave wants to participate in any Caltech educational activities, programs or services, they must meet with a dean and other appropriate administrators to determine any necessary support or accommodations needed while on leave and submit a _\u201cPetition to Participate While on Leave\u201d_ for approval. Failure to gain a dean\u2019s permission to be active on campus will be considered when a student on leave applies to return.\n\n####  While on Medical Leave\n\nIt is the expectation that a student on medical leave will focus on managing\nthe condition(s) that precipitated the leave. Any impending or ongoing conduct\nprocesses will ordinarily be suspended while a student is on medical leave,\nunless the student requests otherwise in writing, and their medical provider\nagrees it is appropriate.\n\n####  Return from Medical Leave\n\nThis requires the following steps:\n\n  1. Submitting a completed Return from Medical Leave form to the deans.\n  2. Signing a release of information form authorizing any treatment providers to communicate with Caltech, including representatives of Health and Counseling Services to determine the student's readiness to return and recommendations for reasonable accommodations. This form is available on the Student Wellness Services website.\n  3. Submitting a provider recommendation form to either the Medical Director of Student Health Services or the Clinical Director of Student Counseling Services, or their designee. The student's healthcare provider should fill out this brief form to summarize their work together; to outline any progress the student has made in treatment; and to state any recommendations for returning to the Institute. This form is available on the Student Wellness Services website.\n  4. After Student Wellness Services has received the provider recommendation form, the student should schedule a meeting with either the Medical Director of Health Services or designee (for leaves related to medical conditions), or the Clinical Director of Counseling Services or designee (for leaves related to emotional, psychological, or psychiatric conditions). In this meeting, the student and the Director will discuss their healthcare provider's recommendations and will discuss the need for any continued treatment. The student should sign a release of information form allowing the Director to communicate a summary of this meeting to the deans. This form is available on the Student Wellness Services website.\n  5. Final approval of the petition is the responsibility of the dean or designee.\n\nA student returning from a leave for medical reasons will maintain the same\nacademic standing that they had previously-i.e., if on academic probation, the\nstudent will remain on probation upon return from leave.\n\n####  Pregnancy Leave\n\nConsistent with Caltech policy and the requirements of Title IX, students who\nare unable to complete their coursework or other course of study for a period\nof time due to a pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions are\neligible for a medical leave of absence. Students who are pregnant or who have\nrecently given birth are also eligible for reasonable accommodations.  \n\nA pregnant student who wishes to take a medical leave should submit a\ncompleted after obtaining a recommendation from the Medical Director of Health\nServices. Medical documentation from the student's treating medical provider\nis required.  \n\nThe Institute also provides reasonable accommodations to pregnant students\nconsistent with federal and state law. Reasonable accommodations may include\nallowing pregnant students to maintain a safe distance from hazardous\nsubstances, allowing them to make up tests and assignments that are missed for\npregnancy-related reasons or excusing of absences that are medically\nnecessary.  \n  \n\n####  Bonding\n\nAn enrolled student in good academic standing who chooses to take a leave of\nabsence because of the birth of his or her child may request a bonding leave\nby submitting a completed petition form for approval.\n\n###  Involuntary Leave\n\nThe dean or designee may determine that it is necessary to place a student on\nan involuntary leave in a variety of circumstances, including when a student\ndemonstrates behavior that poses a threat to health or safety, causes\nsignificant disruption to the Caltech community, for the personal safety or\nwelfare of the student involved, as an interim measure, or as a result of a\ndisciplinary action.  \n\nThe dean may impose an involuntary leave in appropriate circumstances, such as\nwhere a student's behavior: (1) has, or threatens to, cause significant\nproperty damage; (2) significantly disrupts the Caltech community; (3)\npresents a substantial risk of harm to self or others; (4) indicates the\nstudent is unable or unwilling to carry out self-care obligations; or (5)\nviolates a Caltech policy or the honor system. An involuntary leave also may\nbe imposed when that the student requires a level of care from the Institute\ncommunity that exceeds the reasonable accommodations, resources and staffing\nthat the Institute can reasonably be expected to provide for the student's\nwell-being.\n\n####  Review and Decision Process\n\nIn making an informed decision to place a student on involuntary leave in such\ncircumstances, the dean will conduct an individualized assessment and consider\nrelevant information including information provided in a timely manner by the\nstudent. If the conduct has been the subject of an investigation under an\nInstitute process or procedure, the dean will consider the findings and\nconclusions reached in that process.  \n\nThe dean may consult with other Institute personnel, including but not limited\nto, security and residential life personnel, staff, faculty, and other\nindividuals or departments. If appropriate and feasible, the dean may seek\ncooperation and involvement of parents or guardians of the student.  \n\nMedical information, including medical information provided in a timely manner\nby the student, may be considered if the behavior is associated with a\nphysical or mental condition. In appropriate cases, the dean may consult with\nthe director of Wellness Services, or designee, and/or require a physical or\nmental evaluation from a health professional if the dean believes such an\nevaluation is necessary to make an informed decision. Students are expected,\nif necessary, to sign a release of information to facilitate discussions\nbetween Caltech and the health professional conducting the evaluation. The\ndean will also consider whether relevant risk factors can be eliminated or\nreduced to an acceptable level through reasonable accommodation.\n\n####  Written Decision\n\nThe student will be advised in writing of the decision to impose an\ninvoluntary leave. The dean may stipulate conditions that must be met before\nthe student may return. An involuntary leave may be a permanent separation\nfrom the Institute (i.e. expulsion); for a specific duration or until certain\nconditions have been met. If the involuntary leave is not a permanent\nseparation, the student will be advised of the length of the leave and/or any\nconditions for return.\n\n####  Emergency Leave\n\nIf the dean determines that a student's continued presence is likely to pose a\nsubstantial risk to the safety and well-being of the student or others, the\ndean may place the student on an emergency interim leave before a final\ndetermination is made. The dean will make reasonable attempts to meet with the\nstudent and consider relevant information, including in appropriate cases\nmedical information provided by the student, before deciding on an emergency\ninterim leave. An emergency interim leave will remain in effect until a final\ndecision has been made.\n\n####  While on Leave\n\nA student placed on involuntary leave as a disciplinary sanction will not be\nallowed to participate in Caltech educational activities, programs or services\nwithout the express permission of the dean or designee. Requests for an\nexception to this policy should be discussed at the time of the leave\ndecision, and a \u201cPetition to Participate While on Leave\u201d must be approved\nprior to any such participation. Failure to gain permission, and consequently\nbeing active on campus, will be taken into consideration when a student on\ninvoluntary leave applies to return. The same applies to students placed on\ninvoluntary medical leave.\n\n####  Return from Leave\n\nA student on involuntary leave will not be allowed to return until the dean\nmakes a fact-specific assessment of the circumstances, considers relevant risk\nfactors, and concludes that the student does not pose a significant disruption\nto the functioning of the Institute community and/or does not pose a\nsubstantial risk to the health and safety of the student or others. The dean\nwill consider relevant information, including information provided by the\nstudent. In cases where a student has a physical or mental condition\nassociated with the behavior triggering the leave, the dean will also consider\nwhether the relevant risks can be eliminated by a reasonable accommodation.\nThe student will be notified in writing if the dean determines that the\nstudent will not be permitted to return from a leave or will be permanently\nseparated from the Institute.\n\n####  Appeal\n\nA decision by the dean to place a student on involuntary leave may be appealed\nin writing within ten days to the vice president for student affairs (or\ndesignee). If the leave is imposed as a sanction resulting from a finding of\nresponsibility under an Institute process any applicable limitations on\ngrounds for appeal will apply.\n\n"

        "title": "Scholastic Requirements",
        "source": "Caltech Course Catalog / 2024-2025 Catalog / Information for Undergraduate Students / Scholastic Requirements",
        "content": "All undergraduates are required to meet certain scholastic standards as\noutlined subsequently.\n\n##  Eligibility to Be Enrolled\n\nAll undergraduate students must complete a minimum of 27 units per term with a\ngrade-point average of at least 1.9 in order to be eligible to remain enrolled\nin classes. First-year students are not held to the 1.9 GPA requirement during\nthe first two terms. A student may be excused from the 27-unit eligibility\nrequirement if an underload petition has been approved, prior to Add Day, by\nthe dean or associate dean of undergraduate students. Under exceptional\ncircumstances the deans may waive the requirement that such a petition be\napproved prior to Add Day, but may do so only once during that student\u2019s\ncareer at Caltech. In addition, students must earn a total of 108 units per\nyear; this averages to 36 units per term. The 108 unit requirement may be\nwaived in the case of an approved underload by Add Day, terms away, or having\nbeen academically ineligible in one of the past three terms.\n\nWhen a student is ineligible for the first time, students are to send a\nreinstatement petition to the dean or associate dean of undergraduate\nstudents. The dean may choose to reinstate them, in which case they will be on\nacademic probation for their next term of enrollment. Alternatively, the dean\nmay direct them to petition the Undergraduate Academic Standards and Honors\nCommittee (UASH) for reinstatement. UASH will either approve their petition\nfor reinstatement and place them on academic probation, or require them to\nwithdraw from the Institute for at least two terms.\n\nWhen a student becomes ineligible a second time, they will be required to\nwithdraw from the Institute for at least two terms. Summer does not count as a\nterm. A student who has been required to leave the Institute because of\nacademic ineligibility may, after at least two terms of leave, petition the\nUndergraduate Academic Standards and Honors (UASH) Committee for\nreinstatement. The UASH Committee\u2019s decision regarding reinstatement will be\nbased largely on whether or not such students have made good use of their time\nwhile away from the Institute. Useful activities include being gainfully\nemployed, having an internship, engaging in a significant amount of volunteer\nwork, or successfully completing courses at another college or university. The\nCommittee will also expect that students applying for reinstatement will have\ncompleted work in all Caltech classes in which they had received an E or I\ngrade.\n\nWhen a student becomes ineligible a third time, they will not be allowed to\ncontinue to enroll at Caltech.\n\n####  Process for requesting an exception\n\nStudents who are ineligible to petition may request an exception to the above.\nTo do so, they must first obtain permission from two of the following three\nindividuals: the dean of undergraduate students, the chair of the UASH\nCommittee, and the Registrar. Such requests require that a reinstatement\npetition be sent to the Registrar\u2019s Office at least three days prior to the\nnext UASH Committee meeting\u2019s published deadline. When sending the\nreinstatement petition, students are encouraged to include (in the body of the\nemail) an additional note including why the student feels they have an\nexceptional circumstance that should be considered by UASH outside of the\ntypical reinstatement procedures. If the petition receives sufficient votes,\nit will be added to the agenda for the following UASH committee meeting.\n\n####  Students not enrolled due to Academic Ineligibility\n\nAcademically ineligible students who are not reinstated will be separated and\ndropped from any courses for the next academic term. Caltech considers\nacademically ineligible students to be matriculated; however, students not\ncurrently enrolled do not enjoy all rights and privileges of enrolled\nstudents. Separated students (i.e. unenrolled students), have limited access\nto Caltech's educational activities, programs, and services. They do not have\naccess to online services including, but not limited to, REGIS and Canvas.\nThey may not attend classes or labs, live in Institute housing, or access\ncertain student resources, including Student Wellness Services, CASS, and\nResidential Life activities, programs, and services while separated. Career\nAchievement, Leadership, and Exploration (CALE) is, by default, open to all\nstudents who have not been permanently separated from the Institute,\nregardless of leave or enrollment status, unless otherwise revoked by the\nDirector of CALE or the relevant deans' office. For questions regarding the\nfull scope of these limitations, please contact the relevant deans' office.\n\n###  Departmental and Option Regulations\n\nBy the middle of the third term, first-year students must notify the\nRegistrar\u2019s Office of their selection of an option in engineering, humanities,\nsocial sciences, or science to be pursued in subsequent years. Upon the\nselection of an option, a first-year student will be assigned an adviser in\nthat option, whose approval must then be obtained for registration for the\nfollowing year.\n\nUndergraduate students may request to add an approved minor to their program\nof study. The request for a minor must be approved by the option\nrepresentatives of the student\u2019s option and proposed minor. A plan must be\npresented which meets the minimum requirements for both the option and the\nminor, but the option representatives may impose additional requirements as\nwell. The approved request must be submitted to the registrar before the start\nof the senior year.\n\nUndergraduate students may be allowed to major in two options for the Bachelor\nof Science degree. In order to do so the student must present a rationale for\nthe double option and a plan of study leading to completion of the degree in\nfour years. The plan, and any substantive modifications, must be approved by a\ncommittee composed of the option representatives of the two options. The plan\nmust meet the minimum requirements for both options as set forth in this\ncatalog, but the committee may impose additional requirements as well. The\napproved plan should be submitted to the registrar during the sophomore year,\nbut in any case no later than the start of the senior year. The student will\nthen be assigned an adviser by each option. Consult the registrar for\nappropriate procedures.\n\n###  Continuing in an Option\n\nStudents whose grade-point averages are less than 1.9 at the end of an\nacademic year in a specific group of subjects designated by their department\nor option may, at the discretion of their department, be refused permission to\ncontinue the work of that option. Such disbarment does not prevent the\nstudents from continuing in some other option or from taking additional\ncourses to raise their average in their original option. Students without an\noption will fall under the direct jurisdiction of the dean of students.\nStudents may remain without an option for no more than one year.\n\n###  Change of Option\n\nAn undergraduate in good standing at the Institute shall be permitted to\ntransfer into any option of their choice provided they have (a) a 1.9 GPA in\nsubjects required for graduation in that option or in a specific group of\nsubjects designated by that option or (b) permission of the option\nrepresentative or committee. A change of option is effected by obtaining a\nChange of Option petition from the Registrar\u2019s Office. The completed petition\nmust then be signed by the option representative for the new option (who will\nassign a new adviser), and filed with the Registrar\u2019s Office. Institute\nregulations require that a student who has made normal progress at the\nInstitute be able to change options at any time up to the end of the sophomore\nyear without penalty either as to time until graduation or as to excessive\nunit requirements in any term.\n\n###  Term Examinations\n\nTerm examinations will be held in all subjects unless the instructor in charge\nof any subject shall arrange otherwise. No student will be exempt from these\nexaminations. When conflicts exist in a student\u2019s schedule, it is the\nstudent\u2019s responsibility to report the conflict to the instructor in charge of\none of the conflicting examinations and make arrangements for another time.\n\n###  Satisfactory Academic Progress\n\nEligibility to register is determined by the student\u2019s record as of the first\nday of classes of the term in which registration is sought. A student will be\ndeclared ineligible to register if they have completed fewer than 27 units\nwith a 1.9 grade point average in the previous term.\n\n###  Graduation Requirement\n\nTo qualify for graduation a student must complete the prescribed work in one\nof the options with a passing grade in each required subject and with a grade-\npoint average of 1.9. A grade of F in an elective course need not be made up,\nprovided the student has received passing grades in enough other accepted\nunits to satisfy the minimum total requirements of the option.\n\nA Caltech undergraduate degree is based on four years of academic enrollment\n(study abroad included) in which students have the time to explore their\nacademic interests in a deep and rigorous way. Students who are admitted as\ntransfer students or 3/2 students may be granted advanced standing and term\ncredit for academic work accepted in transfer to Caltech. However, transfers\nand 3/2 students must enroll for a minimum of six terms at Caltech. All other\nregularly admitted students must enroll for four years (12 terms). Any\nexceptions to the four year requirement must be approved by the dean of\nundergraduate students and the vice president for student affairs.\n\n###  Candidacy for the Bachelor\u2019s Degree\n\nStudents must declare their candidacy for the degree of Bachelor of Science to\nthe registrar on or before the first Monday of November preceding the date on\nwhich they expect to receive the degree. All subjects required for graduation,\nwith the exception of those for which the candidate is registered during the\nlast term of their study, must be completed and the grade recorded by the\nsecond Monday of May preceding commencement.\n\n###  Graduation in the Normally Prescribed Time\n\nAny undergraduate student who fails to complete the requirements for\ngraduation at the end of 12 terms must petition the Undergraduate Academic\nStandards and Honors (UASH) Committee for approval to register for further\nwork each term.\n\n###  Excess of or Fewer Than Normal Units (Overloads and Underloads)\n\nAn overload is defined as registration for more than 48 units for an\nundergraduate. This limit corresponds to five 9-unit classes plus a 3-unit\nnon-academic class (PE, PVA, SA) or four 9-unit classes plus one 12-unit\nclass. Classroom and laboratory courses are to be limited to 45 units for\nfirst-year students for the first two terms and the remaining three units\nshould be used for frontier (\u201cpizza\u201d) courses, PE, PVA, SA, or research.\nStudents may take up to 51 units (inclusive) but it requires their adviser\u2019s\napproval for such an overload. To take more units than 51, students will need\nto petition the undergraduate dean, with the expectation that permission will\nbe granted only in exceptional cases. This policy is aimed at having no effect\non currently recommended courses of studies in all options, while putting a\nvery high bar for taking 6 full-time classes simultaneously.\n\nA student who wishes to carry an overload in any term must obtain the approval\nof their adviser and the dean or associate dean of undergraduate students.\nPetitions for overloads must be submitted one week before the last day for\nadding classes in any term.\n\nAn underload is registration for fewer than 36 units. Underload petitions for\nfirst-year students, sophomores, and juniors must be approved by the adviser\nand the dean or associate dean of undergraduate students. Seniors may take an\nunderload by presenting for the Registrar\u2019s approval a senior underload\npetition and a course plan for graduation the following June that does not\nrequire an overload in any term. Completing fewer than 27 units without prior\napproval will result in ineligibility; for more information on eligibility,\nsee [Scholastic Requirements](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/information-\nfor-undergraduate-students/scholastic-requirements/#eligibility-to-be-\nenrolled). Underloads during the first 12 terms will not result in a tuition\nreduction, only in a reduction in financial aid. After completing 12 terms,\ntuition will be charged per unit. The dean or disability services coordinator\nwill evaluate exceptions due to medical reasons. For more information about\nunderloads and tuition, see\n[Underloads](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/information-for-\nundergraduate-students/undergraduate-expenses/#underloads). For more\ninformation about impact to aid, see [Underloads and Financial Aid: The Impact\nof Less than Full-time\nEnrollment](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/information-for-undergraduate-\nstudents/financial-aid/part-time-enrollment-underloads/#underloads-and-\nfinancial-aid-the-impact-of-less-than-full-time-e).\n\n##  Allowance and Transfer of Credit\n\n###  Transfer of Credit from Other Institutions\n\nRegularly enrolled students who want to obtain credit for college courses\ntaken elsewhere should obtain the permission of the dean of students and have\na copy of the transcript of their work sent to the Registrar\u2019s Office. The\nstudent should then obtain an Allowance of Credit form from the Registrar\u2019s\nOffice and take this, with the transcript as well as any supporting class\nmaterials required by the option representative, to the representative of the\noption in which credit is desired. Pending approval by the option\nrepresentative, credit will be granted when the Allowance of Credit form, with\nthe appropriate signatures, is returned to the office.\n\n###  Allowance of Credit in the Humanities and Social Sciences\n\nIn general, Caltech students should fulfill Caltech course requirements by\ntaking courses at Caltech. Students are expected to have a well-reasoned\neducational goal for taking classes elsewhere. The only exceptions are\ntransfer students admitted to advanced standing. Credit for comparable work\ndone at other institutions with similar academic standards is not granted\nautomatically.\n\nStudents who wish to take courses elsewhere (whether on leave, in the summer,\nor during the academic year) should consult, in advance, with the executive\nofficer for the humanities or the executive officer for the social sciences,\nor their designees, to minimize any misunderstanding regarding the nature of\ncredit they may receive. Upon completion of the course, the student must\nobtain an Allowance of Credit form from the registrar, obtain the signed\napproval of the executive officer, or their designee, for transfer credit, and\nreturn the completed form to the Registrar\u2019s Office. The executive officers\nare the final authority in the allowance of credit in HSS courses.\n\nGuidelines and specific information about allowance of credit are available\nfrom the Division of the Humanities and Social Sciences.\n\n###  Other Allowances of Credit\n\nExcept for transfer credit and credit based on Caltech placement exams upon\nadmission, credit will not be granted for Caltech courses in which the student\nis not officially enrolled, except in special circumstances by arrangement\nwith the instructor. Such arrangements must be approved by the Curriculum\nCommittee, and the student must petition the Committee before the work is\nundertaken.\n\n###  Good Standing and Academic Probation\n\nGood Standing: A student is in good standing if they meet academic eligibility\nstandards and are not currently on any probationary status (either academic or\ndisciplinary).\n\nAcademic Probation: Following academic ineligibility (failure to meet minimum\nacademic requirements), when a student is reinstated, they will be placed on\nacademic probation for the term until they successfully complete a term.\n\n"

This fee is nonrefundable.\n\nHousing contracts must be submitted to the Housing Office by the date\nspecified in the instructions accompanying the contract.\n\n##  Estimated Cost of Attendance 2024-25\n\nThe chart below lists the estimated nine-month, full-time cost of attendance\nbudgets that are generally applicable to Caltech undergraduate students\nenrolled in the 2024-25 school year. With the exception of the Orientation\nFee, all direct charges, i.e., tuition, fees, housing and food, are divided\nevenly between the fall, winter and spring terms.\n\nCategory  |  On-Campus  |  Off-Campus  |  Living with Parents   \n---|---|---|---  \nTuition  |  $63,402  |  $63,402  |  $63,402   \nFees  1,2  |  2,496  |  2,496  |  2,496   \nHousing  |  11,697  |  14,733  |  _See Living Expenses_  \nFood/Meals  |  8,586  |  7,353  |  _See Living Expenses_  \nBooks, Course Materials, Supplies and Equipment (est.)  3  |  1,428  |  1,428  |  1,428   \nLiving Expenses  |  _N/A_ |  _N/A_ |  11,493   \nPersonal Expenses (est.)  |  3,213  |  4,968  |  4,059   \n**Total Estimated Cost of Attendance 4  ** |  **$90,822** |  **$94,380** |  **$82,878**  \n  \n1\\. Fees do not include the [Caltech Student Health Insurance\nPlan](https://hr.caltech.edu/studentbenefits). Students are not required to\npurchase health and dental insurance through Caltech provided they have\ncoverage through a comparable plan. The plan will cost for health insurance\n$4,998 for the 2024-25 school year\u2014$1,666 per Insurance Term and for dental\ninsurance $135 for 2024-25 school year, one-time fee in Fall term. Financial\naid recipients who enroll in the Caltech Student Health Insurance Plan may\nrequest that the expense be added to their estimated cost of attendance by\ncompleting the **Financial Aid Request for Caltech Student Health Insurance\nPlan** form. Students will be offered grant assistance to cover the additional\nexpense.\n\n2\\. All entering undergraduate students are charged a one-time, $500\nOrientation Fee in addition to the mandatory fees applicable to all\nundergraduate students.\n\n3\\. A reasonable allowance for the purchase of a personal computer may be\nadded to this estimated cost upon request.\n\n4\\. A Travel Allowance to (partially) offset the cost of two round trips from\na student's primary residence may be added to this estimated cost of\nattendance **for U.S. Citizens or eligible non-citizens** who reside in the\nUS, associated US territories, Canada, or Mexico.\n\n###  General Deposit\n\nEach new student is required to pay a general deposit of $100. Upon graduation\nor withdrawal from the Institute, any remaining balance of the deposit will be\napplied to the student\u2019s outstanding balance or refunded if there is no unpaid\nbalance.\n\n###  Payment Information\n\nThe tuition and fees charge for all students is payable in full before the\nfirst day of classes unless the student enrolls in the Transact Payment Plan\nOption per term. The fee to enroll in the plan is $35.00 per term. You will\nneed to enroll during the Enrollment dates only: Fall Term -\n9/11/2024-9/24/2024, Winter Term - 12/11/2024-12/24/2024, and Spring Term\n3/11/2025-3/24/2025.\n\nTuition for the baccalaureate degree is based on four years (12 terms) of\nacademic enrollment regardless of unit load each term or if a student\ncompletes graduation requirements a term(s) early. The 12 term academic\nenrollment requirement is separate from and in addition to any other degree\nrequirements. Official study abroad programs listed in the Catalog fulfill one\nterm of the 12 term requirement.\n\nSince a Caltech degree is based on a four-year enrollment requirement,\nentering students should expect to be on campus and in person and to be billed\ntuition for a full four years. Any exceptions must be approved by the dean of\nundergraduate students and the vice president for student affairs. In\naddition, aid may not be disbursed to a student to cover full tuition if they\nare no longer attending classes.\n\n###  Fees for Late Payment\n\nA $50 late penalty will be charged by the Bursar\u2019s Office for failure to clear\na past-due account at the beginning of instruction.\n\n###  Fees for Late Registration\n\nRegistration is not complete until the student has enrolled in a program\napproved by their adviser and has paid tuition and other fees. A penalty fee\nof $50 is assessed for failure to register within five days of the scheduled\ndates.\n\n###  Unpaid Bills\n\nAll bills owed the Institute must be paid when due. Any student whose bills\nare past due may be refused registration for the following term. All\nundergraduate students with an outstanding bursar\u2019s bill balance of $300 or\nmore will have a hold placed on their registration for the subsequent term the\nday before online registration opens. The hold will be released once payment\nreducing the balance to less than $300 has been cleared by the Institute\u2019s\nbank, which typically occurs 3-5 business days after payment is initiated\nthrough Transact/CASHNet. The hold will be released once students have paid\ntheir bill at the Bursar\u2019s Office. Diplomas will not be released until the\nbursar account is paid in full.\n\n###  Caltech ID Card Charges\n\nIf an undergraduate student owes more than $300, the student\u2019s ID card will be\ndeactivated and they will be unable to charge any new purchases. Cards will be\nreactivated once students have paid their bill in full at the Bursar\u2019s Office.\n\n##  Refunds and Fees\n\n###  Refunds and Repayments\n\nFor all students, the institutional charges, e.g., tuition and housing and\nfood, will be prorated according to the amount of time the student spent in\nacademic attendance before withdrawing from the Institute before the end of\nthe sixth week of the term. These prorated charges will be compared to the\npayments received on behalf of the student, and the Institute will determine\nwhether the student is entitled to a refund or owes additional funds to\nCaltech.\n\nFor students receiving funds from federal Title IV, from Caltech, and/or from\nstate programs, the Institute will follow federal and other applicable\nregulations to determine the amount of all program funds the student has\nearned at the time of withdrawal. In general, the amount of financial aid\nearned is based on the amount of time the student has spent in academic\nattendance. If the amount of aid disbursed to the student is greater than the\namount the student has earned, unearned funds must be returned. If the amount\nthe student was disbursed is less than the amount the student earned, the\nstudent will be eligible to receive a post-withdrawal disbursement.\n\n###  Determining the Student\u2019s Last Date of Attendance or Withdrawal Date\n\nThe Office of the Registrar is responsible for obtaining requests for\nwithdrawal from the undergraduate or graduate dean and for processing official\nwithdrawals. In order to calculate the refund or repayment, Caltech will\nestablish the student\u2019s withdrawal date. This date is one of the following:\n\n  * the date that the student began the withdrawal process prescribed by Caltech;\n  * the date the student otherwise provided official notification to the registrar (written or oral) of their intent to withdraw;\n  * the midpoint of the academic term if no official notification is provided;\n  * the date determined by the registrar if there are special\n  * circumstances (illness, accident, grievous personal loss); or\n  * the date the registrar determines the student has not returned from an approved student sabbatical or if the student does not qualify for a sabbatical.\n\n###  Academically Related Activities that Determine Academic Attendance\n\nThe Institute may use the last date of attendance at an academically related\nactivity as the student\u2019s withdrawal date. This may occur if a student begins\nthe withdrawal process and then attends an academically related activity after\nthat date. Caltech considers an academically related activity to include the\nfollowing:\n\n  * attendance at a lab\n  * attendance at a lecture\n  * completing a quiz and/or test\n  * participation in a study session\n  * academic counseling session\n  * academic advisement session\n  * turning in a class assignment\n\n###  Determining the Return of Federal Funds\n\nThe Financial Aid Office will calculate the federal funds that must be\nreturned to the appropriate federal accounts.\n\nIf a student withdraws from the Institute prior to the first day of classes\nfor the period of enrollment, Caltech will return 100 percent of the student\u2019s\nfederal financial aid in accordance with federal procedures.\n\nIf a student withdraws any time after the first day of classes for the period\nof enrollment, the Institute will perform the following:\n\n  * Determine the percentage of the payment period that the student completed. If the student completed more than 60 percent of the period, they earned 100 percent of the aid for the period. If the student completed 60 percent or less, the percentage of the period completed is the percentage of aid earned. This percentage is determined by dividing the number of days attended in the period of enrollment by the total days in the period.\n  * Apply the earned percentage to the amount of aid actually disbursed and the amount that could have been disbursed (\u201dearned aid\u201d).\n  * Subtract earned aid from aid that was actually disbursed. This results in the amount of unearned aid to be returned.\n  * The Financial Aid Office will allocate the return of funds back to the student aid programs in the following order:\n\n  1. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program\n  2. Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan Program\n  3. Federal Direct PLUS Loan Program\n  4. Federal Pell Grant Program\n  5. Federal SEOG Program\n  6. Other Title IV programs\n\nFederal Work Study is not included in any of these calculations.\n\n###  Appeals on Refunds\n\nAny questions or problems related to refunds should be directed to the\nBursar\u2019s Office. For further information on refunds and repayments, contact\nthe Financial Aid Office, the Graduate Office, or the Bursar\u2019s Office.\n\n###  Underloads\n\nStudents who register for less than 36 units (\u201dUnderload\u201d) will not receive a\nreduction of tuition. Full tuition will be charged to underloading students\u2019\naccounts. Also, applicable financial aid will be reduced, in underload\nsituations. For specific information on underload requirements, and special\ncircumstances where an underload may be granted, see [Excess of or Fewer Than\nNormal Units (Overloads and\nUnderloads)](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/information-for-\nundergraduate-students/scholastic-requirements/#excess-of-or-fewer-than-\nnormal-units-overloads-and-underloads). Information regarding financial aid\nand underloads can be found in\n[finaid.caltech.edu/policies/underloads](https://www.finaid.caltech.edu/policies/underloads).\n\nFor those undergraduate students who are eligible for underloading after\ncompleting 12 terms or by approved medical exception ([Excess of or Fewer Than\nNormal Units (Overloads and\nUnderloads)](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/information-for-\nundergraduate-students/scholastic-requirements/#excess-of-or-fewer-than-\nnormal-units-overloads-and-underloads)), the tuition will be adjusted after\nAdd Day at the AY2024-25 rate of $587 per unit plus $832 for student fees per\nterm. The minimum tuition amount is ten units, a charge of $5,870 per term\nplus the $832 student fee.\n\n###  Dropping a Course\n\nAny student who wishes to carry fewer than 36 units in any given term must\npetition for an underload. Underloads must be approved by the Deans.\nUnderloads for graduating seniors must be approved by the Registrar.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE:** The Institute will charge students for a minimum of 12 terms\nof full-time tuition, even if they complete their degree requirements early.\nStudents may NOT receive scholarship assistance for any term in which they are\nnot enrolled at least half-time.\n\nUndergraduate students who underload in a term will have their financial aid,\nincluding outside scholarships, adjusted based on the actual number of units\nstudents are enrolled in as of Add Day. **_However, the student's Caltech\naccount will be charged full-time tuition._**\n\nAdditional information is available in the Financial Aid Office. For more\ninformation about impact to aid, see\n[finaid.caltech.edu/policies/underloads](https://www.finaid.caltech.edu/policies/underloads)\n\n###  Refund upon Withdrawal\n\nWhen a student, for whatever reason, withdraws from Caltech during an academic\nterm, a refund of tuition as well as housing and food, if applicable, is\ncalculated. The amount of refund is determined by how much of the term has\nelapsed. If the student is a recipient of student financial assistance, that\nassistance, if applicable, will be reduced as a result of their withdrawal.\nRecent federal legislation determines the amount of refund for recipients of\nfederal Title IV student assistance. It is the purpose of this section to\ninform students of the financial implications of withdrawal.\n\nIf the student is not a recipient of federal financial aid, the Institute\u2019s\nrefund policy returns any refund of tuition or housing and food first to the\nprograms from which assistance has been received (i.e., scholarships, Caltech\ngift assistance). Any amount remaining will then be returned to the student.\nThe non\u2013Title IV portion will be distributed as appropriate, first to outside\nagencies, as required, then to the Caltech grant, scholarship, or loan,\ndepending on the composition of the aid package. These distributions will\noccur as credits to the appropriate aid funds and charge(s) to the student\u2019s\nCaltech account.\n\nIf the student is the recipient of federal Title IV student assistance, any\nrefund must then be applied first to the federal aid program(s) in the\nprescribed order listed under [Determining the Return of Federal\nFunds](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/information-for-undergraduate-\nstudents/undergraduate-expenses/#determining-the-return-of-federal-funds).\n\nIn the event that a student\u2019s disbursed financial aid exceeds the direct costs\non the student\u2019s personal account, a credit balance will result. Withdrawal\nwill result in the reversal or repayment of the resulting credit balance.\n\n###  Honor System Matters\n\nMonies owed to the Institute resulting from a disciplinary decision may be\ncollected through the Bursar\u2019s Office, at the request of the dean of students.\n\n###  Special Fees\n\nStudents taking the Summer Field Geology course (Ge 120 ab) should consult\nwith the division about travel and subsistence arrangements and costs.\n\n"

Although the\nInstitute expects students and families to finance the cost of education to\nthe fullest extent possible, the Institute will make every effort to assist\nthose who need help.\n\nDemonstrated financial need is the difference between the annual cost of\nattending Caltech and the amount the student and parents can reasonably be\nexpected to contribute toward those costs. Costs include actual tuition,\nstudent fees, housing, food/meals, books and supplies, and personal expenses.\nFor U.S. citizens or eligible noncitizens who reside in the United States,\nCanada, Mexico, or Guam, costs include a travel allowance designed to\n(partially) offset the cost (airfare) of two round-trips from a student\u2019s home\nduring the academic year. Caltech\u2019s estimate of a family\u2019s ability to\ncontribute is determined annually in accordance with nationally established\nguidelines.\n\nEligibility for each type of assistance varies, depending upon the source of\nfunds.

If you have sufficient need and meet the specifications for one or\nmore named scholarships, you will be automatically considered for those\nscholarships.\n\nAny named scholarships you receive will be used to replace a portion of your\nCaltech Scholarships. If you receive a named scholarship, you may be asked to\nwrite a thank-you letter to one or more donors.

        "content": "Loans can be an invaluable resource for financing an education. While loans\nare a type of financial aid, they are not a gift like [grants and\nscholarships](https://www.finaid.caltech.edu/typesofaid/grants), since loans\nneed to be repaid eventually. Loans are mostly a tool for liquidity\nmanagement: students can postpone paying a portion of their educational costs\nuntil they complete their education or leave school. The repayment period on\nmost loans can extend up to 10 years after graduation or leaving school.\n\nGraduating with educational debt is a fairly common experience for students.\nAt Caltech, however, the average educational indebtedness at graduation is\nsignificantly lower than the national average for students attending four-year\nprivate and public colleges. [See borrowing statistics at\nCaltech](https://www.finaid.caltech.edu/typesofaid/loans/disclosure).\n\n**Disclosure**\n\n  * Federal Student Loans are required by law to provide a range of flexible repayment options, including but not limited to, income-based repayment and income contingent repayment plans, and loan forgiveness benefits which other student loans are not required to do.\n  * Federal loans are available to students regardless of income.\n\n##  The Federal Direct Loan Program\n\nThis program offers eligible students and parents the opportunity to borrow\nmoney directly from the federal government to help pay the cost of attendance\nat Caltech. The U.S. Department of Education makes loans, through Caltech,\ndirectly to students and/or parents. The Institute will use the loan(s) to pay\nyour tuition/fees and other direct charges such as housing and food/meals, and\ngive the student any remaining money for indirect costs. Students and/or\nparents make their repayments directly to the federal government.\n\n###  Direct loans include\n\n  1. The Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program;\n  2. The Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan Program;\n  3. The Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan Program; and\n  4. The Federal Direct Consolidation Loan Program.  \n\n###  Federal Direct Stafford Loan\n\nThere are two types of Federal Direct Stafford Loans: subsidized and\nunsubsidized. The federal government pays the interest on subsidized loans\nwhile the borrower is enrolled at least half-time and during authorized\nperiods of deferment. The interest on unsubsidized loans begins to accrue\nimmediately upon disbursement and is generally capitalized (added to the\namount borrowed) when the borrower is no longer enrolled at least half-time.\n\nEligibility for Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans is based on financial need as\ndemonstrated by the FAFSA. Students who do not demonstrate sufficient need or\nwhose need is met may borrow Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans provided their\ntotal financial aid, including the Stafford Loan, does not exceed the total\nestimated cost of attendance.\n\nDependent undergraduate students (excluding students whose parents cannot\nborrow Parent PLUS loans) may borrow Stafford Loan amounts not to exceed an\nannual total of\n\n  * $5,500 for first-year students, with a maximum of $3,500 in subsidized Stafford;\n  * $6,500 for second-year students, with a maximum of $4,500 in subsidized Stafford; and\n  * $7,500 for third- and fourth-year students, with a maximum of $5,500 in subsidized Stafford.\n\nIndependent undergraduate students and dependent undergraduate students whose\nparents are unable to borrow Parent PLUS loans may borrow additional Direct\nUnsubsidized Stafford Loan amounts not to exceed an annual total of\n\n  * $9,500 for first-year students, with a maximum of $3,500 in subsidized Stafford;\n  * $10,500 for second-year students, with a maximum of $4,500 in subsidized Stafford; and\n  * $12,500 for third- and fourth-year students, with a maximum of $5,500 in subsidized Stafford.\n\nGraduate students may borrow Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan amounts not to\nexceed an annual total of $20,500.\n\nThe maximum outstanding total subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford Loan debt\nis\n\n  * $31,000 for dependent undergraduate students, with a maximum of $23,000 in subsidized Stafford;\n  * $57,500 for independent undergraduate students (or for dependent undergraduate students whose parents do not qualify for PLUS loans), with a maximum of $23,000 of this aggregate amount in the form of subsidized loans; and\n  * $138,500 for graduate students (including loans for undergraduate study), with a maximum of $65,500 of this aggregate in the form of subsidized loans.  \n\n###  Stafford Loan interest rates\n\nThe interest rate on subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford Loans disbursed for\nenrollment periods that begin after July 1, 2024 is currently scheduled to be\nfixed at **6.53%** for undergraduate students.\n\n##  Undergraduate students:\n\n**Enrollment Periods** **Beginning Between** |  **Interest Rates**  \n---|---  \n**Subsidized** |  **Unsubsidized**  \nJuly 1, 2024 - June 30, 2025  |  6.53%  |  6.53%   \nJuly 1, 2023 - June 30, 2024  |  5.50%  |  5.50%   \nJuly 1, 2022 - June 30, 2023  |  4.99%  |  4.99%   \nJuly 1, 2021 - June 30, 2022  |  3.73%  |  3.73%   \nJuly 1, 2020 - June 30, 2021  |  2.75%  |  2.75%   \nJuly 1, 2019 - June 30, 2020  |  4.53%  |  4.53%   \n  \n##  Graduate students:\n\n**Enrollment Periods** **Beginning Between** |  **Interest Rates**  \n---|---  \n**Unsubsidized**  \nJuly 1, 2024 \u2013 June 30, 2025  |  8.08%   \nJuly 1, 2023 \u2013 June 30, 2024  |  7.05%   \nJuly 1, 2022 \u2013 June 30, 2023  |  6.54%   \nJuly 1, 2021 \u2013 June 30, 2022  |  5.28%   \nJuly 1, 2020 \u2013 June 30, 2021  |  4.30%   \nJuly 1, 2019 \u2013 June 30, 2020  |  6.08%   \n  \nStafford loans are also subject to a loan fee, which is a percentage of the\nloan amount.

Direct Stafford Loans have a six-month grace\nperiod that starts the day after the borrower graduates, leaves school, or\ndrops below half-time enrollment. Repayment begins when the grace period ends.\nDeferments are available for new borrowers during at least half-time\nenrollment at an eligible institution; during periods of academic study in\napproved graduate fellowship or rehabilitation programs; and for periods of\nunemployment and economic hardship.\n\nApplications for Federal Direct Stafford Loans are available on the Caltech\nFinancial Aid Office website\n[finaid.caltech.edu/typesofaid/loans/stafford](https://www.finaid.caltech.edu/typesofaid/loans/stafford).\nComplete information on Stafford Loan deferments and repayment options is also\navailable from the Financial Aid Office.\n\n"

        "content": "Most financial aid funds are credited directly to your student account and are\napplied first to institutional charges for the current term. Funds are\ncredited no earlier than 10 days prior to the first day of the term. Aid that\ncan be credited directly to your account will be credited when you have\naccepted or declined your awards on [access.caltech](http://access.caltech);\n\n  * provided all required documents for the aid programs you have been awarded\n  * made satisfactory academic progress;\n  * enrolled in at least the minimum number of credits for the financial aid programs you have been awarded;\n  * completed all necessary loan documents and, for first-time Direct Stafford Loan borrowers, completed the online Entrance Interview.\n\nIf the disbursement of aid results in a credit balance, any aid awarded in\nexcess of institutional charges will be paid to the student as a refund.\nRefunds must be requested by the account holder. Requests may be made by\ne-mail or in person at the Bursar\u2019s Office. Prior to receiving funds, you will\nneed to complete the Bursar\u2019s Account Refund Form located\n[here](https://bursar.caltech.edu/refunds). Refunds can be obtained by ACH\ndirect deposit or by check. Refund checks are requested by the Bursar\u2019s Office\nand issued by Accounts Payable and usually take 2-3 weeks to receive in the\nmail from the day of request.\n\nOutside scholarships are usually disbursed in the form of a check and must be\nhandled according to the sponsor\u2019s specifications. If the funds are sent to\nthe Financial Aid Office or the Bursar\u2019s Office, they will be credited to your\naccount. Again, if the crediting of any outside scholarship results in a\ncredit balance on your account, you may request that the credit balance be\nrefunded to you. Federal regulations allow Caltech to credit financial aid\nfunds to your account for payment of tuition, fees, housing and food/meals\ncharges. You must give the Bursar\u2019s Office written authorization to keep a\ncredit balance on your account from one term to the next term during the\nacademic year. Federal guidelines prohibit keeping a credit balance from one\nacademic year to the next. If you complete your financial aid file late in the\nterm, resulting in the late disbursement of your financial aid funds, you may\nbe subject to late fees assessed by the Bursar\u2019s Office.\n\nCal Grant B stipend payments will be credited to your tuition account unless\nyou contact the Financial Aid Office in person within the first three weeks of\nthe term to make alternate arrangements. Again, if the crediting of any\nfinancial aid results in a credit balance on your account, you may request\nthat the credit balance be refunded to you.\n\nIn general, loans are disbursed in three installments, one at the beginning\neach term. For most Caltech students who are enrolled for the full academic\nyear, this means that one-third of their loan(s) will be disbursed at the\nbeginning of the fall term, another at the beginning of the winter term, and\nthe final third at the beginning of the spring term. Students whose loan\nperiods are for one term receive their entire disbursement at the beginning of\nthat term.\n\nIf you work through either the Federal Work-Study or the Caltech Work-Study\nprogram, you will be paid by check through the biweekly Caltech payroll\nsystem. Checks are normally distributed at your actual work site.\n\nSince financial aid is generally awarded on the assumption of full-time\nenrollment, it is possible that some or all of your aid will need to be\nadjusted if your enrollment status results in a reduction in your tuition for\na term. If you withdraw or drop below half-time enrollment after the last day\nfor adding classes for a term, you may be required to repay all or a portion\nof the aid that has already been credited to your account. You must inform the\nFinancial Aid Office if you take a leave of absence or change your enrollment\nsubsequent to receiving your financial aid. Cal Grant recipients who take a\nleave of absence are advised to contact the California Student Aid Commission\n([csac.ca.gov](http://www.csac.ca.gov)) and submit a form to remain eligible\nfor the program.\n\nYou have the right to cancel your loan(s) any time before disbursement and up\nto 14 days after disbursement.\n\n"

        "content": "Federal and state regulations governing student financial aid programs require\nthe Institute to ensure that each student who is receiving financial aid\nmaintains Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) toward their degree.\n\nThe SAP check occurs after grades are posted at the end of each term. Failure\nto meet the standards of satisfactory academic progress may disqualify a\nstudent from additional federal, state and institutional financial aid. A\nstudent can appeal their unsatisfactory academic progress status and be placed\non warning, probation or continued on probation for financial aid purposes.\n\n##  Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements\n\n**Academic Requirements**  \nAll undergraduates are required to meet certain scholastic standards as\noutlined in the Catalog. The details can be found at the link below under\nScholastic Requirements.\n\n[**https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/information-for-undergraduate-\nstudents/scholastic-\nrequirements/**](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/information-for-\nundergraduate-students/scholastic-requirements/)\n\n##  Financial Aid Warning\n\nStudents who are found not to be making satisfactory academic progress at the\nend of an academic term will be ineligible to register. For the first such\nineligibility, the petition may be acted on by the dean or associate dean of\nundergraduate students, after consultation with the student and examination of\nthe record. At the dean's discretion, such cases may be referred to the UASH\nCommittee for action. If given permission to register, students will be on\nacademic probation and will be placed on financial aid warning. A student may\ncontinue to receive financial aid for one term while on financial aid warning\nstatus. Students should use this opportunity to re-establish SAP.\n\n##  Financial Aid Probation\n\nStudents who fail to make satisfactory academic progress after their term of\nfinancial aid warning will be ineligible to register and ineligible for\nfinancial aid. Students may appeal this status as outlined in the _Caltech\nCatalog_. Ineligible first-year students must petition the UASH Committee for\nreinstatement if they wish to continue as students and continue to receive\nfinancial aid. The dean of students or associate dean may act on a petition if\nit is the student\u2019s first ineligibility.\n\nUndergraduate students, except first- and second-term first-year students, may\nsubmit a petition to the UASH Committee for reinstatement, giving any reasons\nthat may exist for their previous unsatisfactory work and stating any new\nconditions that may lead to better results. Each such petition will be\nconsidered on its merits. For the first such ineligibility, the petition may\nbe acted on by the dean of undergraduate students, after consultation with the\nstudent and examination of the record. At the dean\u2019s discretion, such cases\nmay be referred to the UASH Committee for action. All subsequent\nreinstatements must be acted upon by the Committee.\n\nStudents who are reinstated as a result of their appeal/petition for\nreinstatement will be placed on financial aid probation and may receive\nfinancial aid for an additional academic term.\n\n##  Continued on Financial Aid Probation\n\nStudents who fail to make satisfactory academic progress after a term on\nfinancial aid probation will be ineligible to register and ineligible for\nfederal and state financial aid. These students may appeal this status as\noutlined above and in the _Caltech Catalog_.\n\nA student who is continued on financial aid probation and again fails to make\nsatisfactory academic progress would almost certainly not be allowed to\ncontinue their enrollment. If, however, they successfully petition the UASH\nCommittee for reinstatement, they would be continued on financial aid\nprobation for a second term. Technically, a student may be continued on\nfinancial aid probation for up to three consecutive terms but their\nscholarship eligibility will be reduced in each of those terms.\n\n##  Financial Aid Suspension\n\nStudents who fail to make satisfactory academic progress after being continued\non financial aid probation for three additional terms will be ineligible for\nfederal, state _and institutional financial aid_ , even if they are\nsubsequently reinstated by the UASH Committee, until such time as they make\nsatisfactory academic progress.\n\n##  Maximum Time Frame for Receiving Aid\n\nA student has a limited time frame to complete all degree requirements and\nremain eligible for financial aid. As defined by federal regulations, the\nmaximum time frame is 150 percent of the published program length for degree\ncompletion.\n\nTo qualify for a Bachelor of Science degree, students must complete a minimum\nof 486 units which translates to 486 x 150% = 729 maximum attempted units.\n\nAn \u201cattempted\u201d unit is defined as any unit that a student remains enrolled in\nAFTER the Add Period, including units the student withdraws from each term.\nUnits that a student is retroactively enrolled in after the Add Period are\nconsidered attempted units.\n\n"

        "source": "Caltech Course Catalog / 2024-2025 Catalog / Information for Undergraduate Students / Financial Aid / Part-Time Enrollment (Underloads)",
        "content": "The Institute will charge students for a minimum of 12 terms of full-time\ntuition, or the prorated equivalent based on their classification at the time\nthey begin their enrollment, even if they complete their degree requirements\nearly. Undergraduate students who underload in a term will be charged full-\ntime tuition but their financial aid, including outside scholarships, will be\nadjusted as indicated below based on the actual number of units students are\nenrolled in as of Add Day. Students may NOT receive scholarship assistance for\nany term in which they are not enrolled at least half-time.\n\n##  Underloads and Financial Aid: The Impact of Less than Full-time Enrollment\n\nAny student who wishes to carry fewer than 36 units in any given term must\npetition for an underload. Underloads must be approved by the Dean or\nAssociate Dean of Undergraduate Students. Underloads for graduating seniors\nmust be approved by the Registrar. (See [Underload\nPolicy](https://www.finaid.caltech.edu/policies/underloads)).\n\nThe reduction in financial aid is generally done in the following order:\n\n  1. Federal Pell Grant\n  2. Caltech scholarships in the current term\n  3. Caltech scholarships awarded in other terms\n  4. Self-help aid (such as loans and work-study)\n\nIf the necessary reduction is greater than the total amount of financial aid\nyou were awarded for the year, you will lose all of your financial aid for the\ncurrent academic year.\n\nThe following information summarizes the impact of less than full-time\nenrollment on financial aid.\n\n##  3/4 Time\n\nFull-time enrollment is defined in the Caltech Catalog as 36 units. Students\nenrolling less than full-time, taking between 27 to 35 units, are considered\nenrolled 3/4 time. The impact to their financial aid is usually a reduction to\ntheir grant, in the same amount as the reduction in their tuition. Federal\nPell Grant recipients will have their Federal Pell award reduced according to\nfederal regulations. The Financial Aid Office will revise the student\u2019s budget\nto reflect the calculated per-unit tuition and then revise the student\u2019s aid\n(grant eligibility) to reflect the reduction in calculated need. _However, the\nstudent's Caltech account will be charged full-time tuition._\n\n##  1/2 Time\n\nHalf-time enrollment is defined as enrolling in 18 to 26 units. In this\nsituation, the Financial Aid Office will revise the budget for financial aid\npurposes to reflect the calculated per-unit tuition and reduce the books and\nsupplies allowance to 1/2 of the standard amount for that term. Federal Pell\nGrant recipients will have their Pell award reduced according to federal\nregulations. The Financial Aid Office will revise the student\u2019s budget to\nreflect the per-unit tuition and other reductions in education related costs\nand then revise the student\u2019s aid (grant eligibility) to reflect the reduction\nin calculated need. Students enrolled 1/2 time can also anticipate an increase\nin their work-study award for the term. _However, the student's Caltech\naccount will be charged full-time tuition._\n\n##  Less than 1/2 Time\n\nLess than 1/2 time enrollment is defined as taking fewer than 18 units.\nTuition is revised based on the units enrolled in as of Add Day. As indicated\nin the Caltech Catalog, the minimum tuition charge is 10 units per term. The\nbooks and supplies allowance is reduced to 1/4 for that term. The student's\naid is reduced based on the reduced student aid budget. Federal Pell Grant\nrecipients will have their Pell award reduced according to federal\nregulations. More importantly, the student becomes ineligible for Caltech\ngrant aid for that term; the student will only be eligible for Caltech work\nstudy and/or loan assistance. If the student is enrolled less than half time,\nthe grace period on any student loan (CIT loan, Institute loan and Federal\nStafford loan) will begin. In addition, a student/family is no longer eligible\nfor Federal PLUS or Stafford loans during periods of less than \u00bd time\nenrollment. _However, the student's Caltech account will be charged full-time\ntuition._\n\n##  Effect on Outside Scholarships\n\nIn all of the above categories, the Financial Aid Office also checks to see if\na student has an outside scholarship that requires continuous full-time\nenrollment. If a scholarship donor requires full time enrollment, the\nFinancial Aid Office is required to return the scholarship money for that term\nto the donor. If this occurs, the student is encouraged to contact the donor\ndirectly to review and, possibly, appeal the agency\u2019s policy.\n\n##  Questions\n\nStudents with questions regarding underloads should discuss their individual\ncircumstances with a financial aid administrator. Contact the office with any\nquestions you have.  \n\n"

        "content": "A Caltech education requires not just the depth of an option, but also\nconsiderable breadth in basic science, humanities, and social science.\nCaltech\u2019s core curriculum prepares students for the interdisciplinary nature\nof contemporary research in science and technology. This encourages a culture\nof problem solving, collaboration, and communication while providing valuable\nexperience in all fields of science. Significant study in the humanities and\nsocial sciences is an important component of Caltech\u2019s core curriculum, giving\nalumni the ability to navigate the societal, political, and economic factors\nthat influence, and are influenced by, their work.\n\nThe following requirements are applicable to incoming first-year students for\n2024-25. Some information for continuing students has been provided as\nfootnotes, but guidance on special cases must be sought. Courses used to\nsatisfy core requirements may not be used to satisfy option electives.\n\n**Courses** |  **Units**  \n---|---  \n1\\. First-Year Mathematics (Ma 1 abc)  |  27   \n2\\. First-Year Physics (Ph 1 abc)  |  27   \n3\\. First-Year Chemistry (Ch 1 ab)  |  15   \n4\\. First-Year Biology (Any Bi 1 course or Bi 8 and Bi 9)  1  |  9   \n5\\. Menu Class (currently Ay 1, EE 1, ESE 1, Ge 1, or IST 4)  |  9   \n6\\. First-Year Chemistry Laboratory (Ch 3 a or Ch 3 x)  2,3  |  6   \n7\\.

Humanities Courses (as defined below)  |  36   \n11\\. Social Sciences Courses (as defined below)  |  27   \n12\\. Additional Humanities and Social Sciences Courses  |  36   \n13\\. Physical Education  |  9   \n  \n_1_ _The biology core requirement can be met by any Bi 1 course.\nAlternatively, the requirement may be fulfilled by taking both Bi 8 and Bi 9.\nNine units must be taken on grades._\n\n_2_ _These courses can be taken First or Second Year as P/F._\n\n_3_ _This requirement can also be met by completing Ch 3 a, Ch 8, or Ch/ChE\n9._\n\n##  Course Load in First Year\n\nFirst- and second-term first-year students will be limited to 45 units of\nclassroom and laboratory courses. If a student chooses no electives except\nphysical education and takes the minimum permissible laboratory courses, the\ntotal unit requirement will usually be in the range of 39 to 45. A total load\n- including electives - of more than 48 units per term is considered a heavy\nload. Loads of more than 51 units require approval by the dean of students.\n\n##  Grading Policies for First-Year Students\n\nCore courses taken in the first two terms will be graded on pass/fail. All\npermanent grades recorded for first-year students in Core classes during the\nfirst and second terms they are enrolled will be either P, in indicating\n\"passed,\" or F, indicating \"failed.\"\n\nCourses taken in the first two terms from a select list of introductory\ncourses (below) will be graded on pass/fail. If a first-quarter or second-\nquarter First-Year student is enrolled in a course from the list of\nintroductory courses below, and the instructor for that courses gives letter\ngrades, the registrar will record P for all passing grades.\n\nThe list of introductory courses to which this policy applies is: Bi 8, Ma 2,\nMa 3, Ph 2ab, Ph 12ab, Ch 41ab.\n\nStudents who wish to take non-Core, non-introductory classes must take those\nclasses according to the published grading scheme. In other words ,classes\nthat are not part of the Core curriculum or the list of introductory classes\nabove, even if taken in the first two quarters of the first year, can only\ncount towards fulfilling graduation requirements if their grading scheme meets\nthe requirement of the particular option. For example, supposed a student\nwants to fulfill their graduation requirements for the Computer Science (CS)\noption. In that case, they cannot take a CS course that is not part of the\nCore curriculum as pass/fail and use it to meet the requirements for that\noption. This is because the CS option prohibits pass/fail grading schemes for\nfulfilling its requirements. As a result, the student must take the CS course\nfor a grade if they wish to fulfill the CS option requirement. Computation of\ngrade-point averages begins at the end of the third term of the first year;\nthe cumulative grade-point average will include any letter grades received for\nnon-Core non-introductory classes taken for letter grades during the first two\nterms of the first year. First-quarter and second-quarter First-Year students\nreceive pass/fail grades in all Core and introductory courses listed by virtue\nof their classification as First-Year students by an admissions committee or,\nfor students whose status after the first year is uncertain, by the\nUndergraduate Academic Standards and Honors Committee.\n\n##  Menu Classes\n\nMenu classes are specifically designed for breadth. The intent of the menu\nclass requirement is to introduce students to a subject that they did not plan\nto study. In many cases, it is the only class in that subject that they ever\ntake; in other cases, they may decide to take more classes in that subject as\na result. Students cannot take a menu class in a subject that they have\nalready taken classes in or in their current option. This requirement must be\ncompleted by the end of sophomore year.\n\n##  First Year Biology Requirement\n\nAll students are required to take 9 units of first-year biology, which can be\nsatisfied by taking any course numbered Bi 1. Several different course options\nare available, with each Bi 1 course representing a different approach to\nproviding an introductory understanding of the biological sciences. Bi 1\ncourses are offered in different terms. All Bi 1 courses may be taken\npass/fail if they are taken in a first-year student's first year, independent\nof the term in which the course is taken. For students who are interested in a\nmore in-depth introduction to biology, the first-year biology requirement can\nalso be satisfied by completing both Bi 8 and Bi 9, with one of them taken for\ngrades.\n\n##  Introductory Laboratory Requirement\n\nAll students are required to take at least 12 units of laboratory work in\nexperimental science during their first and sophomore years. Ch 3 a (6 units)\nor Ch 3 x (6 units) shall be taken during the first year or second years. The\nadditional 6 units must be chosen from one of the following (or a more\nadvanced laboratory): APh/EE 9 (6 units), APh/EE 24 (9 units), Bi 1 x (9 units\nbut only if Bi 1 x is not being used to satisfy the biology core requirement),\nBi 10 (6 units), Ch 4 ab (9 units), Ch 8 (9 units), Ch/ChE 9 (9 units), EE/ME\n7 (6 units), Ge 116 (9 units), ME 8 (6 units), Ph 3 (6 units), Ph 5 (9 units),\nPh 8 bc (6 units). Computational laboratory courses may not be used to satisfy\nthis requirement.\n\n##  Humanities and Social Sciences Requirements\n\nAll students must complete satisfactorily 99 units in the Division of the\nHumanities and Social Sciences. Of these, 36 must be in the humanities\n(English, history, history and philosophy of science, humanities, music,\nphilosophy, and visual culture) and 27 in the social sciences (anthropology,\nbusiness economics and management, economics, law, political science,\npsychology, and social science). The remaining 36 may be drawn from humanities\nand social sciences, including HSS tutorial courses and 9 units of either Wr 1\nor Wr 2. They may not include BEM 102. They may not include reading courses\nunless credit has been granted by petition to the humanities or social science\nfaculty. Language courses may count toward the additional 36 unit requirement,\nwith the exception of beginning, intermediate, and advanced classes in the\nstudent\u2019s native language. In general, no more than 18 units of first-year\nhumanities may be counted toward the 99-unit requirement.\n\nEntering first-year students are required to take two terms of first-year\nhumanities; that is, cross-listed humanities courses numbered 60 or below in\nthe _Catalog_. These classes introduce students to the basic issues and\nmethods in the disciplines of English, history, philosophy, and visual\nculture. Successful completion of two terms of first-year humanities is a\nprerequisite for all humanities courses, except for foreign languages. It is\n_not_ a prerequisite, however, for introductory social sciences. The first-\nyear humanities classes may be taken in any two terms of the first year.\n\nTo encourage breadth, students will have to take their two first-year\nhumanities courses in different disciplines, the disciplines being English,\nhistory, philosophy, and visual culture.\n\nA student must take 18 units of advanced humanities courses as well. The\nclasses that count as advanced humanities courses are those numbered 90 or\nabove in English, history, history and philosophy of science, humanities,\nmusic, philosophy, and visual culture. Language courses do not count toward\nthe advanced humanities requirement, except for courses that are cross-listed\nor taught concurrently with one of the listed subjects, such as humanities or\nvisual culture. Courses used to fulfill the advanced humanities requirement\nmust be taken for grades. Courses taken on a pass/fail basis will not fulfill\nthe requirement.\n\nSince writing is an important method for developing and sharing ideas, all\nfirst-year humanities courses and other humanities courses numbered above 90,\nwith the exception of some foreign languages and courses, require at least\n4,000 words of composition. Instructors give extensive feedback on written\nwork and help students improve their prose. As entering students may not be\nfully prepared for the writing in first-year humanities, all first-year and\ntransfer students take a writing assessment before the beginning of the fall\nterm. On the basis of this assessment, some students may be required to pass\nWR 2, 3, 4 and/or 50 before entering either first-year or advanced humanities\nclasses.\n\nStudents are required to take two introductory social science courses and 18\nunits of related advanced undergraduate social science courses. Courses used\nto fulfill the advanced social science requirement must be taken for grades;\ncourses taken on a pass/fail basis will not fulfill the requirement. The\nintroductory social science courses must be drawn from the following list:\neither Ec 11, PS 12, or Psy 13. The 9 units of advanced undergraduate social\nscience courses (numbered 100 and above), in fields following at least one of\ntheir introductory courses, must be taken as indicated here:\n\n**Introductory Course** |  **Following Course**  \n---|---  \nEc 11  |  advanced economics or   \nBEM (except BEM 102)  \nPS 12  |  advanced political science   \nPsy 13  |  advanced psychology   \n  \nFor instance, a student who has taken PS 12 and Ec 11 may use 9 units of\nadvanced political science courses or 9 units of advanced economics courses.\n\nIncluded in the 11 humanities and social science courses, students must take\nat least 3 writing-intensive courses and these must be taken on grades. The\ngraded advanced humanities courses count towards this total. A student can\nselect another course from advanced humanities or a social science course with\nwriting content (specifically An/PS 127, BEM 109, Ec 105, Ec 109, Ec 129, Ec\n130, Ec 140, PS 99 ab, PS 120, PS 123, or PS 141). These three writing-\nintensive courses should be spread out over the student\u2019s sophomore, junior,\nand senior years.\n\n##  Physical Education Requirement\n\nBefore graduation, each undergraduate is required to successfully complete 9\nunits of physical education. This requirement may be satisfied entirely or in\npart by participation in intercollegiate athletics, or successful completion\nof physical education class course work. All grades are issued pass/fail. A\nmaximum of 6 units per term may be applied toward graduation requirements,\nwith the total not to exceed 36 units. Participation as a bona fide member of\nan intercollegiate team for the period covered by the sport in a given term\nsatisfies the requirement for that term.\n\nA broad program of instruction is provided each term. Late registration is\npermitted during the first week of each term, provided there is space\navailable and with permission of the instructor. Standards for evaluation of\nstudent performance will be clearly defined at the beginning of each course.\n\n##  Scientific Writing Requirement\n\nThe following courses are suggested for each option, but the scientific\nwriting requirement can be satisfied by taking an appropriate course offered\nby any division. The course used to satisfy this requirement must be taken on\ngrades. All options also require a three-unit course in oral communication.\nSome options combine these two requirements into one course. At the discretion\nof the option, the scientific writing requirement can be satisfied by three\nunits of additional work associated with a senior thesis, focused on effective\nwritten scientific communication.\n\n**Options** |  **Requirements**  \n---|---  \n|  _Oral_ |  _Written_  \nACM, APh, CNS,  \nCS, EE, EAS, IDS, ME, MS  |  SEC 10  |  one of SEC 11, SEC 12, or SEC 13   \nAy  |  Ay 30  |  Ay 31   \nBi, BE  |  Bi/BE 24  |  same   \nBEM, Ec, PS  |  En/Wr 83 or En/Wr 84  |  same   \nChE  |  ChE 126  |  Ch/ChE 91   \nCh  |  Ch 90  |  Ch/ChE 91   \nEn, H, HPS, Pl  |  En/Wr 83 or En/Wr 84  |  same   \nGPS  |  See Option Requirements  |  ESE/Ge 21   \nMa  |  Ma 10  |  Ma 11   \nPh  |  Ph 70  |  same \n\n"

These courses cover a wide range of topics,\nincluding earthquakes, gravitational waves, and the science of music.\nInstructors may allow sophomores, juniors, or seniors to enroll in these\nseminars after the conclusion of the pre-registration period for the upcoming\nterm. See section on First-Year Seminars for more information.\n\nCaltech also offers a series of \u201cfrontier courses\u201d that involve a weekly\npresentation by a faculty member on a topic of current research. These courses\noften meet at lunch time and serve pizza; hence, students refer to the courses\nas \u201cpizza courses.\u201d The frontier courses are an opportunity for students to\nmeet the Caltech faculty and to hear about state-of-the-art research projects\nfor the summer or academic year. There are a total of 10 frontier courses\noffered for first-year students in biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics,\ngeology and planetary sciences, engineering, computer science, chemical\nengineering, bioengineering, and electrical engineering.\n\nCurrently there are three \u201cresearch tutorials\u201d for first-year students: one in\nphysics, one in biology, and one in chemistry. These tutorials have many of\nthe same features as the first-year seminars. In physics, the research\ntutorial includes approximately seven first-year students and extends over\nthree academic terms plus the summer. The purpose is to demonstrate how\nresearch opportunities arise, are evaluated, and are tested, and how the ideas\nthat survive develop in larger projects. In biology and chemistry, the\ntutorials are offered in the winter and spring quarters and involve small\ngroup discussions on special areas or problems in biology, biotechnology, and\nchemistry.\n\nMore than 80 percent of Caltech students participate in research at some point\nin their academic career. Students may embark on research activities by\nregistering for research credits with a faculty member, by working in a\nlaboratory for pay during the summer or academic year, by completing a senior\nthesis, or by participating in Caltech\u2019s Summer Undergraduate Research\nFellowship (SURF) program.

The course schedule above is an example\nleading to excellent preparation for graduate study, but it is also possible\nto fulfill the option requirements with a more diverse set of electives across\noptions, and even to take Ay 20, 21 junior year and Ay 101, 102 senior year.\nIn either scenario, it is desirable for a student to gain as broad a\nbackground as possible in related fields of science and engineering. An\nability to present one\u2019s work is vital to a successful career in any field.\nThe oral communications requirement can be satisfied by presenting during a\nterm of Ay 141, or with Ay 30. Ay 31 satisfies the written communication\nrequirement.\n\nStudents are encouraged (but not required) to undertake research leading to a\nsenior thesis; credit for this work is provided through Ay 78 with the process\nand requirements fully described there. Non-thesis research credits may be\nearned through Ay 142 with a maximum of 9 units per term. Elective credit can\nbe given for no more than 27 units of Ay 142.\n\nComputational skills may be acquired through e.g. ACM 11, ACM 106, CS 2, CS\n11, CS 21, CS 38, CS 121, CMS 155, Ph 20, Ph 21, Ph 121.\n\nStudents are strongly advised to take advanced mathematical methods in ACM95\nand Ph 129, and an advanced statistical physics or thermodynamics course such\nas Ph 127.\n\n  \n**Suggested Electives**  \nThe student may elect any course offered in any division in a given term,\nprovided that they have has the necessary prerequisites for that course. The\nfollowing courses are useful to work in various fields of astronomy and\nastrophysics: ACM 95, ACM 106, ACM 112, APh 17, APh/EE 23/24, APh/EE 117, APh\n123, Ay 104, Ay 105, Ay 107, Ay 117, Ay 121\u2013127, Ch 125 ab, EE 45, EE/Ae 157,\nGe/Ay 11 c, Ge 103, Ge/Ch 128, Ge 131, Ge/Ay 132, 133, 137, Ge 141, Ma 4, Ma\n112, ME 11, ME 12, Ph 20\u201322, Ph 77, 101, 121, 127, 129, 136, 137, 199, 236\n(this is not necessarily a complete list).\n\n##  Ay Option Minor\n\nThe Ay minor is expected to appeal to student interest in the field of\nastronomy that arises from overlap, not only with the most traditional area of\nphysics, but with more recent and rapidly developing intersections of\nastronomy. Recent Ay minors have had major options in computer science,\nengineering, chemistry, planetary science, and mathematics.\n\nAy minor coursework is designed to prepare the capable student to undertake\ncross-disciplinary research involving astronomy. A firm basis for this is\nestablished with sophomore level physics and astronomy requirements. Junior\nyear courses sample from among the Ay major requirements and electives. Both\ntraditional theory courses and more hands-on practical training courses are\navailable, with one course of each type recommended for breadth. Senior year\nfeatures research and written presentation of the research, with additional\nelectives encouraged.\n\nCourses taken in the minor option must be taken for grades (no P/F), except\nfor Ay 142 which is offered as P/F only. Courses 100 and above can not be used\nto also satisfy requirements in the student\u2019s major option.\n\n##  Ay Option Minor Requirements\n\n  1. Basis in physics: either Ph 2ab or Ph12 ab (18 units)\n  2. Introductory Astronomy: any two of Ge/Ay 11c, Ay 20, or Ay 21 (18 units)\n  3. In-depth Astrophysics, Instrumentation, and Data: any two among: Ay101, Ay 102, Ay 104, Ge/Ay 133, Ay 105, Ay/Ge 107, Ay 122 (18 units)\n  4. Research: both Ay 142 (9 units) and Ay 144 (3 units) = (12 units)\n\n**Total units required: 66**\n\nOther courses of interest to students seeking Ay minor competency include Ay\n119, Ay 198, Ay 141, Ph 2c/12c, Ph 101, EE 40, APh/EE 23. These do not\ncontribute to credit for the minor, however.\n\nCourse selection should be done in consultation with the Ay option\nrepresentative, who can advise on an appropriate curriculum for a given\nstudent\u2019s goals.\n\nAs a complement to the required Ay 142 enrollment, SURF research with the\nrelevant Ay, Ph, or Pl.Sc. faculty member is encouraged.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope\n\nThe undergraduate option in biology is designed to build on a solid foundation\nin mathematics and physical science by providing an introduction to the basic\nfacts, concepts, problems, and methodologies of biological science. The option\nserves as a basis for graduate study in any field of biology or for admission\nto the study of medicine. Instruction is offered in the form of participation\nin the ongoing research programs of the division, as well as in formal course\nwork. Course work emphasizes the more general and fundamental properties of\nliving organisms, and areas of current research interest, rather than the\ntraditional distinct fields within the life sciences.\n\nThe division encourages undergraduate participation in its research program\nand believes that research participation should be a part of each student\u2019s\nprogram of study. Students may elect to prepare an undergraduate thesis (Bi\n90). Research opportunities may be arranged with individual faculty members,\nor guidance may be obtained from a student\u2019s individual faculty adviser in the\ndivision or from the biology undergraduate student adviser.\n\nThe requirements listed below for the biology option are minimal requirements.\nAn adequate preparation for graduate work in biology will normally include\nadditional elective research or course work in biology and/or advanced course\nwork in other sciences or in mathematics. Flexibility to accommodate varied\nindividual scientific interests, within the broad scope of biology, is\nachieved through the provision of elective courses, arrangements for\nindividual research (Bi 22), and tutorial instruction (Bi 23). In addition,\narrangements may be made to take courses at neighboring institutions in fields\nof biology that are not represented in our curriculum.\n\n###  Premedical Program\n\nThe undergraduate course for premedical students is essentially the same as\nthat for biology students and is intended as a basis for later careers in\nresearch as well as in the practice of medicine. It differs in some respects\nfrom premedical curricula of other schools; however, it has been quite\ngenerally accepted as satisfying admission requirements of medical schools.\n\nIt is recommended that all students contemplating application to medical\nschool consult with the premed adviser at Careers, Advising, and Experiential\nLearning or Professor Mitchell Guttman in the Division of Biology and\nBiological Engineering.\n\n##  Bi Option Requirements\n\nThe following required courses must all be taken on grades, with the exception\nof Bi 8 if taken as a first-year student and Bi 22. First-year students taking\nBi 8 must maintain shadow grades that indicate satisfactory progress.\n\n  1. Bi 8, Bi 9, Bi 117, Bi 122, NB/Bi/CNS 150, and Ch 41 abc.\n  2. Ma 2, Ma 3, and any two terms of Ph 2 abc. BE/Bi 25 can be taken in place of Ph 2 c. This requirement can also be satisfied in part by successfully taking a \u201dreasonable\u201d replacement for any of these required courses. A \u201dreasonable\u201d replacement will be defined by: (1) Equally or more advanced quantitative coursework, e.g. Ch 21 a for Ph 2 b, Ch 21 c for Ph 2 c and; (2) Essentially similar scope of subject matter as the course replaced. The Biology option representative will be empowered to make this determination with aid of an advisory list which can be updated as relevant new courses are developed inside and outside of biology.\n  3. One advanced laboratory course (100- or 200-level), or Bi 21 with presentation, or three terms of undergraduate thesis (Bi 90 abc).\n  4. Two courses chosen from Ch/Bi 110 a, 110 b, 111, and/or BMB/Bi/Ch 170, 173 or Ch 145.\n  5. Scientific writing requirement met by taking Bi/BE 24 (six units), or by taking any other writing course such as En/Wr 84 (nine units) plus oral presentation at SURF Seminar Day or equivalent, with option representative approval.\n  6. A minimum of 8 courses of biology electives must be taken. To count as a biology elective, a course must satisfy the following:\n    1. The course is not used to satisfy requirement 1-5.\n    2. 100-level or above.\n    3. The course must be a biology or a bioengineering course.\n    4. At least two elective courses must be nine units each, and must be taken for grades.\n    5. A minimum total of four elective courses must be taken for grades.\n  7. Exceptions are as follow:\n    1. Substantial lab research for credit (Bi 22) beyond the 12- unit minimum can be counted among the electives.\n    2. Courses from other options with significant relevance to biology may be used as electives with permission from the biology option representative.\n  8. A minimum total of 170 units of biology must be taken and passed. Any Bi 1 course, Bi 2, Bi 10, and BE/Bi/CNS/NB 197 cannot be counted toward this total. Bioengineering courses used for electives can be counted toward this total.\n  9. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including the courses listed above.\n\n**Planning the Biology Course Schedule**\n\n  * Most students interested in biology elect to take Bi 8 and Bi 9 in their first year, to open access to the widest range of biology electives.\n  * Bi 10 or Bi 1x is not required for the biology option but is commonly taken by biology students to meet the Institute introductory laboratory requirement.\n  * Prerequisites listed for individual biology courses are advisory, not compulsory. They indicate the kind of background that is assumed for the work level of the course. They may be waived if the instructor gives explicit permission.\n  * BE/Bi 25 is strongly recommended for students interested in postgraduate work in biology, as physical chemistry is required by most graduate programs.\n  * Additional courses of potential interest to biology majors include Ge 11 b, BE 159, BE/Bi/APh 161, BE/ChE 163, BMB/Ch 178 and advanced geobiology courses.\n  * Undergraduates are generally welcome to take 200-level courses with the instructor\u2019s permission or strong preparation, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n##  Bi Typical Course Schedule (Required courses and representative examples\nof electives)\n\n|  |  _Units per term_  \n---|---|---  \n|  |  _1st_ |  _2nd_ |  _3rd_  \n_First year_  \nMa 1 abc  |  First-Year Mathematics  |  9  |  9  |  9   \nPh 1 abc  |  First-Year Physics  |  9  |  9  |  9   \nCh 1 ab  |  General Chemistry  |  6  |  9  |  \\-   \nHum <= 60  |  First-Year Humanities  |  9  |  \\-  |  9   \nCh 3 a  |  Chemistry Lab  |  \\-  |  6  |  \\-   \nCS 1  |  Introduction to Computer Programming  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nBi 8  |  Foundational Principles of Molecular Biology  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \nBi 9  |  Cell Biology  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \nBi 10  |  Introductory Biology Laboratory  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  6   \n|  **Total** |  **42** |  **42** |  **42**  \n_Second year_  \nMa 2  |  Differential Equations  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nMa 3  |  Introduction to Probability and Statistics  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \nPh 2 bc  |  Sophomore Physics  |  9  |  9  |  \\-   \n|  OR  |  |  |   \nBE/Bi 25  |  Biophysical Chemistry  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \nCh 41 abc  |  Organic Chemistry  |  9  |  9  |  9   \n|  Introductory Social Sciences  |  9  |  \\-  |  9   \nBi 122  |  Genetics  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nBi 117  |  Developmental Biology  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \nNB/Bi/CNS/ 150  |  Introduction to Neuroscience  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  10   \nTwo electives in spring, e.g.,  |  |  |  |   \nBi 160  |  Molecular Basis of Animal Evolution  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \nBi/BE/BMB 115  |  Viruses and Application for Biological Systems  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \n|  **Total** |  **45** |  **45** |  **46**  \n_Third year_  \n|  Advanced Humanities  |  \\-  |  9  |  9   \n|  Advanced Social Sciences  |  9  |  \\-  |  9   \n|  Additional HSS  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \nCh/Bi 110 a or b  |  Introduction to Biochemistry  |  12  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nCh/Bi 111  |  Biochemistry of Gene Expression  |  \\-  |  12  |  \\-   \nBi/BE 24  |  Technical Communication (fall or spring)  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  6   \nTwo electives in fall, e.g.,  |  |  |  |   \nBi 145 a  |  Tissue and Organ Physiology  |  9  |  |  \\-   \nESE/Bi 166  |  Microbial Physiology  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nBi/CNS/NB 195  |  Mathematics in Biology  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nTwo electives in winter, e.g.,  |  |  |  |   \nBi/Ge/ESE 105  |  Evolution  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \nBi/BE 119  |  Morphogenesis of Developmental Systems  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \nBi 116  |  Microbial Genetics  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \nBi/BE 183  |  Introduction to Computational Biology and Bioinformatics  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \nTwo electives in spring, e.g.,  |  |  |  |   \nBi/CNS 158  |  Vertebrate Evolution  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \nBi/BMB 189  |  The Cell Cycle and Genomic Stability  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  6   \nBE/Bi 101  |  Order of Magnitude Biology  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  6   \nBegin taking research credits  |  |  |  |   \nBi 22  |  Undergraduate Research  |  6  |  6  |  6   \n|  **Total** |  **45** |  **45** |  **46**  \n_Fourth year_  \n|  Additional HSS  |  9  |  9  |  9   \nTwo to three electives each term, e.g.,  |  |  |  |   \nBE/Bi 103 a  |  Introduction to Data Analysis in the Biological Sciences  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nNB/Bi/CNS/ 154  |  Principles of Neuroscience  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nBi 190  |  Systems Genetics  |  6  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nBi 192  |  Introduction to Systems Biology  |  6  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nBi/BE 129  |  The Biology and Treatment of Cancer  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \nBi 214  |  Stem Cells and Hematopoiesis  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \nBE/Aph 161  |  Physical Biology of the Cell  |  \\-  |  12  |  \\-   \nGe/Bi 159  |  Astrobiology  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \nBE 107  |  Exploring Biological Principles through Bio-Inspired Designs  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \nBE 153  |  Case Studies in Systems Physiology  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \nNB/Bi/CNS/ 157  |  Comparative Nervous Systems  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \nBi 180  |  Plant and Soil Science  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nPursue an in-depth research project:  |  |  |  |   \nBi 90  |  Undergraduate Thesis  |  12+  |  12+  |  12+   \n|  **Total** |  **40+** |  **40+** |  **40+**  \n  \n##  Biology Minor Requirements\n\nThe biology minor is intended to supplement one of Caltech\u2019s undergraduate\ndegrees.

The option's breadth enables its students\nto make an impact in a variety of fields, such as: researching sustainable\ntechnologies (energy efficiency, pollution management, climate mitigation,\nbiofuels); inventing novel biotechnologies (enzyme engineering, cell\nculturing, pharmaceuticals); and developing processes for organic (polymers,\nfilms, fuels, pharmaceuticals) and inorganic (semiconductors, ceramics)\nproducts.\n\nThis is accomplished through a mixture of interdisciplinary classes that\nexpose students to: most fields of science (chemistry, physics, mathematics,\nbiology); core chemical engineering principles; and an area of specialization.\nThe inherently computational nature of chemical engineering shines through\ncourses\u2019 active use of computational software such as Python, Matlab,\nMathematica and COMSOL for modelling and data analysis. At the same time,\nclasses and independent projects also focus on systematic analysis and problem\nsolving, incorporating social, economic, environmental, and technical\nconstraints to tackle the open-ended challenges of today and tomorrow with new\nand creative solutions. Undergraduate research is emphasized, and students are\nencouraged, even in the first year, to participate in research with faculty.\n\nFirst-year students normally take core courses in mathematics, physics,\nchemistry, and biology (Ma 1 abc, Ph 1 abc, Ch1 ab, Bi 1), as well as general\nchemistry lab (Ch3a or Ch 3x). First-year students may take ChE 15 or wait\nuntil their second year. In their second year, students take advanced courses\nin math and science, including differential equations (Ma 2), applied math\n(ACM 95 ab), wave physics (Ph 2a), organic chemistry (Ch 41 ab), and organic\nchemistry lab (Ch/ChE 9).\n\nThe option\u2019s curriculum begins in students\u2019 second year and continues through\ntheir third year with fundamental studies in heat transfer, fluid mechanics,\nmass transfer, thermodynamics, reactor design, and chemical kinetics. While\nstill building a common foundational toolkit, third-year students also begin\nto specialize in one of five tracks: biomolecular, sustainability, process,\nmaterials, computational. Students learn and use design principles in multiple\nlab courses that entail hands-on, open-ended projects relevant to current\nresearch so students can innovatively apply chemical engineering concepts.\nStudents may also pursue an undergraduate thesis to explore research topics\nunder the mentorship of professor - proposing a research plan, applying\nrelevant lab techniques, and presenting results through project reports, oral\npresentation, and written thesis. More information about the option and track\nrequirements can be found on: https://tinyurl.com/2kxfnnva.\n\nAttention is called to the fact that any student whose gradepoint average is\nless than 1.9 at the end of an academic year in the subjects listed under the\nDivision of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering may, at the discretion of the\nfaculty in this division, be refused permission to continue the work in this\noption.\n\n##  ChE Option Requirements\n\n  1.

It is designed for students who wish to broaden their\nstudies beyond their major to include chemical engineering. Students\ncompleting the chemical engineering minor requirements will have the phase\n\"minor in chemical engineering\" added to their transcripts. The chemical\nengineering minor requirements include:\n\n  1. ChE Core: ChE 63A, ChE 103a, ChE 103b, ChE 101\n  2. If ACM 95ab is not required for your major option, fulfill (2a). If ACM 95ab is required for your major option, fulfill (2b) instead of (2a):\n    1. Math, Advanced: ACM 95ab\n    2. ChE, Additional: any two of [ChE 63b, ChE 103c, ChE 105]\n\n3\\. ChE, Electives: at least 18 additional units of courses from any of: (a)\nChE 63b, (b) approved 100 level ChE-listed courses, or (c) ChE 80 (no more\nthan 9 units)\n\nCourses that are used to satisfy the chemical engineering minor requirements\ncannot be used to satisfy course requirements in the major option(s) not for\nanother minor. All courses to be applied to fulfill the chemical engineering\nminor requirements must be taken for grades (not P/F), unless the course is\nonly offered P/F. Students must maintain an average grade of B- or higher for\nall courses with no individual grade lower than a C. Courses taken as part of\nthe chemical engineering minor are counted toward the total 486 units needed\nfor Institute graduation requirements. As a complement to the required\ncourses, SURF research with a relevant chemical engineering faculty member is\nencouraged.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope\n\nThe objective of the undergraduate option in chemistry is to produce graduates\narticulate in the fundamental concepts of the molecular sciences through a\ncombination of coursework and laboratory experiences. The chemistry program at\nCaltech provides depth in the traditional areas of chemistry\u2014organic and\ninorganic chemistry, chemical physics, theoretical chemistry, chemical\nbiology, and biochemistry. Breadth in the program is found within the advanced\ncoursework offerings and the specialized interests of the faculty, which may\ninclude topics such as: chemical synthesis and catalysis, chemical dynamics\nand reaction mechanisms, biochemistry, bioinorganic, bioorganic, and\nbiophysical chemistry, nonlinear spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and materials\nchemistry.\n\nChemical research at Caltech is highly interdisciplinary, reflecting the\nincreasing importance of molecular understanding to many fields of science.\nMajor initiatives are fostering broad collaborations in molecular medicine,\nsustainability, environmental science, and nanomaterials.\n\nCaltech offers a Biochemistry Track within the chemistry option. Biochemistry\nis the study of the chemistry of biological macromolecules and how they enable\ndiverse biological function. This track prepares students in this\ninterdisciplinary area through a combination of coursework offered by Biology,\nChemistry, and bioengineering as well as a senior research thesis in a chosen\nsubject area in biochemistry. The Biochemistry Track provides for a wider\nrange of coursework in Biology. Upon graduation, the diploma will read\n_Chemistry (Biochemistry)._\n\nThe outcome of the undergraduate program in chemistry is to prepare students\nfor advanced graduate study and ultimately careers in teaching and research at\ncolleges and universities, in research for government and industry, in\nchemical technology from tech startups to corporations, and in leadership and\npolicy positions.\n\nA two-term general chemistry course Ch 1 ab is taken by all first year\nstudents. The emphasis is on fundamental principles and their use in\nsystematizing descriptive chemistry. Ch 1 ab must be passed to satisfy the\nInstitute chemistry requirement. The student\u2019s qualifications for placing out\nof Ch 1 ab will only be determined by the performance on a placement\nexamination to be administered in the summer prior to registration. The one-\nterm required laboratory course (Ch 3 a or 3 x) presents basic principles and\ntechniques of synthesis and analysis and develops the laboratory skills and\nprecision that are fundamental to experimental chemistry. Students interested\nin Chemistry as a major are encouraged \u2013 though not required \u2013 to take Ch 3 a.\nQualified students, with the consent of the instructor and the option\nrepresentative, are allowed to substitute either Ch 4 a, Ch 8, or Ch/ChE 9 for\nthe core requirement of Ch 3 a or Ch 3 x. First-Year students interested in\nthe Biochemistry track are encouraged to take Bi 8 (as a substitute for the Bi\n1 Core requirement) and Bi 9, if possible. First year students intending to\nmajor in chemistry are encouraged to take Ch 10 abc, a 3-unit introduction to\nresearch activities and opportunities in chemistry for undergraduates.\n\nBeyond the first year, each student in the chemistry option, in consultation\nwith their adviser, selects a suitable course of study under the supervision\nof the division. The requirements of the option are listed below. A student\nwishing to deviate from these requirements should submit an alternate\ncurriculum, with justifications, for consideration by their adviser and the\nChemistry Curriculum and Undergraduate Studies Committee. The chemistry option\nrepresentative should be consulted for the future scheduling of courses not\noffered during the current academic year.\n\nUndergraduates in the option must also take chemistry courses below the 100\nlevel for a letter grade with the exception of the following courses, which\nare only offered on a pass/fail basis: Ch 1, Ch 3 a or Ch 3 x, Ch 90, and, if\ntaken during the first or second terms as a first-year student, Ch 4 ab, Ch 21\nab, and Ch 41 ab.\n\n###  Ch Senior Thesis\n\nChemistry majors are strongly encouraged to undertake a Senior Thesis, though\nit is not a requirement.\n\nStudents attempting a senior thesis in the chemistry option must complete the\nfollowing requirements.\n\n  1. Three terms (27 units) of Ch 82 are to be completed during the junior and/or senior year of study; continued work from research experiences prior to the commencement of the senior thesis is encouraged.\n  2. By Add-Day of the first term of Ch 82, the candidate will submit a short (five-page) proposal delineating their project for approval by the research mentor and the Chemistry Curriculum and Undergraduate Studies Committee (CUSC).\n  3. The candidate will present a short progress report (maximum of five pages) at the end of each of the first two terms of Ch 82, describing the status of the research work and any results obtained. Upon evidence of satisfactory effort, the student will be allowed to continue their senior thesis.\n  4. A thesis of approximately 20 pages (excluding figures and references) will be presented to the mentor and the CUSC at the end of the third term of Ch 82. An oral thesis defense will be arranged by the CUSC. The thesis must be approved by both the research mentor and the CUSC.\n  5. Upon approval by the research mentor and the CUSC, the Ch 91 requirement for graduation may be satisfied by the written thesis and the progress reports from the first two quarters of Ch 82. A draft of the thesis is to be submitted by Week 7.\n\n###  Ch Double Majors\n\nFor students simultaneously pursuing a degree in a second option, courses\ntaken as _required_ courses for that option can also be counted as chemistry\nelectives (requirement 3, below) where appropriate. However, courses that\ncount toward the electives requirement in the other option cannot\nsimultaneously be counted toward satisfying the elective requirement in\nchemistry.\n\n##  Graduation Requirements\n\nThe courses listed below would constitute a common core for many students in\nthe option.\n\nAny student of the chemistry option whose grade-point average is less than 1.9\nwill be admitted to the option for the following year only with the special\npermission of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. Passing\ngrades must be earned in the courses that constitute the approved program of\nstudy, including those listed below. None of the courses satisfying option\nrequirements may be taken pass/fail.\n\n##  Ch Option Requirements (non-Biochemistry)\n\n  1. Ch 14, Ch 21abc, Ch 41abc, Ch 90, Ma 2, and Ph 2a. Ma 3 is recommended but not required. Students may make the following substitutions: For Ch14 (ESE/Ge 142); for Ch 21a (Ph 2b, Ph 12b, Ch 125a or Ph 125a); for Ch 21c (Ph 2c, Ph 12c, ChE/Ch 164 or Ph 127a). 100-level courses used in substitution for these option requirements may not also be counted towards the five terms of advanced electives. The Ch option requires Ch 90, Oral Presentation. Ch 91 is required to meet the Institute Core Requirement for Scientific Writing. The senior thesis can be used to satisfy the minimum requirement if the third term is taken for grades and a thesis is approved. Ch 91 is not required for students in the Biochemistry Track.\n  2. A minimum of five terms of laboratory work chosen from Ch 4ab, Ch 5ab, Ch 6, Ch 7, Ch 11, and Ch 15. One non-chemistry laboratory course may be used, chosen from MS 90, Ph 6 and Ph 7, or an alternative with sufficient Chemistry content, by approval of the Option Representative. One term of research, either 10 c (if taken during first or second year) or one term of Ch 82 (Senior Thesis), if taken for grades as the third and final term, may count for one of the five laboratory courses.\n  3. A minimum of five terms of advanced chemistry electives (which must total at least 45 units) from chemistry course offerings numbered 102 or higher, including cross-listed offerings but excluding Ch 180 and Ch 280. Students may petition to substitute up to but no more than one 100-level elective from another option, if the substituted course has substantial chemistry content. Ch 101 cannot be used to meet the five term requirement but can be used to meet the 45 unit requirement for advanced electives.\n\nThe chemistry option strongly encourages students to engage in academic year\nresearch, and up to 27 units each of Ch 80 and Ch 82 can count toward the\n486-unit requirement.\n\n##  Ch Typical Course Schedule\n\n|  |  _Units per term_  \n---|---|---  \n|  |  _1st_ |  _2nd_ |  _3rd_  \n_Second Year_  \nCh 41 abc  |  Organic Chemistry  |  9  |  9  |  9   \nMa 2  |  Sophomore Mathematics  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nPh 2 a  |  Sophomore Physics  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nCh 4 ab  |  Synthesis and Analysis of Organic and Inorganic Compounds  |  \\-  |  9  |  9   \nCh 102  |  Intro to Inorganic Chemistry  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \n|  Electives  |  18-21  |  18-27  |  9-21   \n|  **Total** |  **45-48** |  **36-45** |  **36-48**  \n_Third Year_  \nCh 5 a  |  Advanced Techniques of Synthesis and Analysis  |  \\-  |  12  |  \\-   \nor Ch 5 b  |  |  12  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nCh 15  |  Chemical Equilibrium and Analysis Laboratory  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  10   \nCh 21 abc  |  Physical Chemistry  |  9  |  9  |  9   \nCh 14  |  Chemical Equilibrium and Analysis  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \nCh 90  |  Oral Presentation  |  \\-  |  3  |  \\-   \nCh/ChE 91  |  Scientific Writing  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  3   \n|  Electives  |  18-30  |  24-24  |  32-35   \n|  **Total** |  **45-48** |  **45-48** |  **45-48**  \n_Fourth Year_  \nCh 6  |  Physical and Biophys.

Several representative programs,\nincluding sets of possible electives, are shown below. These may well\napproximate choices by students who intend to do graduate work in conventional\nareas of chemistry.\n\n##  Suggested Representative Courses of Study for Those Intending Graduate\nWork in Particular Areas of Chemistry\n\n__ |  _Second Year_ |  _Third Year_ |  _Fourth Year_  \n---|---|---|---  \n_Inorganic_  \n_Chemistry_ |  Ch 4 ab, Ch 41 abc, Ch 102, Ma 2, Ph 2 a, HSS elective, other elective  |  Ch 5 b, Ch 14,   \nCh 21 abc,  \nCh laboratory,  \nCh elective(s),  \nCh 80, Ch 90,  \nCh/ChE 91, Ch 112,  \nHSS elective  |  Ch 6 or Ch 15, Ch electives,   \nCh 82, HSS  \nelective  \n_Chemical_  \n_Physics_ |  Ch 4 ab, Ch 14, Ch 21 abc, Ch 102, Ma 2, Ma 3, Ph 2 a, HSS elective  |  Ch 6, Ch 15, Ch 41 abc, Ch   \nelective(s),  \nCh 80, Ch 90,  \nCh/ChE 91,  \nHSS elective  |  Ch 125 ab, Ch laboratory, Ch electives,   \nCh 82, HSS elective  \n_Organic_  \n_Chemistry_ |  Ch 4 ab, Ch 41 abc, Ch 102, Ma 2, Ph 2 a, HSS elective, other elective  |  Ch 5 a, Ch 7,   \nCh 14, Ch 21 abc, Ch 104, Ch elective(s), Ch laboratory, Ch 80, Ch 90, Ch/ChE\n91,  \nHSS elective  |  Ch 6, Ch 15, Ch electives,   \nCh 82, HSS elective  \n  \n##  Biochemistry Track Requirements\n\n  1.

By graduation, students will have acquired\nknowledge in neurobiology, computation principles across different systems,\nmethods used in modern neuroscience research, as well as the ability to\ncritically evaluate and understand neuroscience literature, and be able to\nwork in a team and communicate effectively.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, students are expected to complete a series of math\nand physics courses to establish solid quantitative skills. Then, they are\nexpected to take two groups of courses, of which one has a biology focus,\nwhile the other has a CS focus. Through these courses, students are exposed to\ndifferent sub-disciplines of neuroscience while also acquiring the\nquantitative skills needed in graduate research and industry jobs. Students\nwill receive instruction in scientific communications through SEC 10 and SEC\n11, SEC 12, SEC 13, or Bi/BE 24.\n\nUndergraduate research is encouraged both during the academic year and through\nparticipation in summer research programs.\n\nStudents with a grade-point average lower than 1.9 will not be allowed to\ncontinue in the option except with special permission from the option\nrepresentative.\n\n##  CNS Option Requirements\n\n  1.

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope\n\nThe objective of the undergraduate program in Electrical Engineering at\nCaltech is to produce graduates who will attain careers and higher education\nthat ultimately lead to leadership roles in academia, industry, and government\nin areas of rapidly advancing interdisciplinary technology related to\ntelecommunications, solid-state, robotics, information, computer and\nelectrical systems.\n\nThe program prepares its students for either graduate study, entrepreneurial\ncareers, or research and development work in government or industrial\nlaboratories. It inspires them to undertake careers and professional practices\nthat provide an opportunity to address the pressing technological needs of\nsociety. It accomplishes this by building on the core curriculum to provide a\nbroad and rigorous exposure to the fundamentals (e.g., math, science, and\nprinciples of engineering) of electrical engineering. EE\u2019s other program\nobjectives are multiple. The program strives to maintain a balance between\nclassroom lectures and laboratory and design experience, and it emphasizes the\nproblem formulation, system-design, and solving skills that are essential to\nany engineering discipline. The program is also intended to develop in each\nstudent self-reliance, creativity, teamwork ability, professional ethics,\ncommunication skills, and an appreciation of the importance of contemporary\nissues and lifelong intellectual growth. For interested students, there are\nopportunities to conduct research with a faculty member.\n\nStudents electing this option normally choose to take the introductory seminar\nEE 2 as a first-year elective. The formal study of electrical engineering\nbegins in the sophomore year with courses such as, deterministic analysis of\nsystems and circuits, EE 44; mathematics of electrical engineering, EE 55;\nintroduction to digital logic and embedded systems, EE/CS 10 ab; physics of\nelectrical engineering, EE/APh 40; and the theory and laboratory practice of\nanalog circuits, EE 45. The junior year features the fundamentals of signal-\nprocessing systems and transforms, EE 111; introduction to probability models,\nACM/EE/IDS 116; electromagnetic engineering, EE 151, or fundamentals of\ninformation transmission and storage, EE/CS/IDS 160; and analog electronics\nprojects laboratory, EE 90. In the senior year, the student will be asked to\ndemonstrate their ability to formulate and carry out a design or research\nproject by taking the senior project design laboratory, EE 91 ab, or senior\nthesis, EE 80 abc. In addition, the student throughout their studies and\nespecially in the senior year, will have a significant opportunity to take\nelective courses that will allow them to explore earlier topics in depth, or\nto investigate topics that have not been covered previously. (See \u201csuggested\nelectives\u201d.)\n\nA motivated student may choose to pursue a specialization within Electrical\nEngineering by choosing one of the tracks offered within the Electrical\nEngineering option. These tracks allow the student to focus on a specific area\nwithin EE while still attaining a broad background in Electrical Engineering.\nUpon graduation the diploma will read Electrical Engineering (track name). The\navailable tracks are Circuits & Electronics, Computer Engineering, Intelligent\nSystems, and Medical Engineering.\n\nA student whose interests lie in the electrical sciences but who wishes to\npursue a broader course of studies than that allowed by the requirements of\nthe Electrical Engineering option may elect the Engineering and Applied\nScience option.\n\nAttention is called to the fact that any student who has a grade-point average\nless than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the subjects listed under\nelectrical engineering may be refused permission to continue work in this\noption.\n\n##  EE Double Majors\n\nThe Electrical Engineering option allows interested students to declare\nElectrical Engineering as one of the majors in a double major pursuit. To\nenroll in the program, the student should meet and discuss their plans with\nthe option representative. In general, approval is contingent on good academic\nperformance by the student and demonstrated ability for handling the heavier\ncourse load. For students simultaneously pursuing a degree in a second option,\ncourses taken as required courses for that option can also be counted as EE\nelectives where appropriate. However, courses that count toward the electives\nrequirement in the other option cannot be simultaneously counted toward\nsatisfying the electives requirement in EE. To qualify for an Electrical\nEngineering degree, the student would need to complete all option\nrequirements.\n\n##  EE Option Requirements\n\n  1. Ma 2, EE 2, SEC10, one of SEC 11-13, EE/CS 10ab, EE/APh 40, EE 44, 45, 55, 90, and 111.\n  2. Two of Ph 2a, Ph 2b, Ph2c, or APh/EE 23 (Ph 12 can replace Ph 2).\n  3. Three of ACM 95a, ACM 95b, ACM/IDS 104, or ACM/EE/IDS 116.\n  4. EE 151 or EE/CS/IDS 160.\n  5. EE 91ab or this requirement can be waived if a student completes EE 80abc.\n  6. In addition to the above courses, 72 units selected from any EE course numbered over 100 or any other EE-related engineering or science course numbered over 100 (such as CDS 110 or CNS/Bi/Ph/CS/NB 187) with approval of the Undergraduate Option Representative.\n  7. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including courses listed above. Courses used to satisfy requirements 1 through 6 must be taken for grades, unless they are only offered pass/fail.\n\n##  EE Typical Course Schedule\n\n|  |  _Units per term_  \n---|---|---  \n|  |  _1st_ |  _2nd_ |  _3rd_  \n_Second Year  \n_  \nEE 44  |  Deterministic   \nAnalysis of Systems and Circuits  |  12  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nEE 55  |  Mathematics of Electrical Engineering  |  12  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nEE/APh 40  |  Physics of Electrical Engineering  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \nEE 45  |  Electronics Systems and Laboratory  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  12   \nEE/CS 10 ab  |  Introduction to Digital Logic and Embedded Systems  |  \\-  |  6  |  6   \nMa 2  |  Differential Equations  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nPh 2 ab  |  Sophomore Physics  |  9  |  9  |  \\-   \n|  Electives  |  \\-  |  9  |  9   \n|  HSS Electives  1  |  \\-  |  9  |  18   \n|  **Total** |  **42** |  **42** |  **45**  \n_Third Year  \n_  \nEE 111  |  Signal-Processing Systems and Transforms  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nEE 151  |  Electromagnetic Engineering  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \nEE/CS/IDS 160  |  Fundamentals of Information Transmission and Storage  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \nEE 90  |  Analog Electronics Project Lab  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \nACM/EE/IDS 116  |  Introduction to Probability Models  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nACM 95 ab  |  Intro.

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope\n\nThe engineering and applied science (EAS) option offers students the\nopportunity for study in a wide variety of challenging areas of science and\ntechnology by allowing each student to design a customized course of study\nthat has breadth, depth, and rigor similar to the options listed above.\n\nThe aim of the EAS option is to prepare students for research and professional\npractice in an era of rapidly advancing interdisciplinary technology. The\nprogram builds on the core curriculum to combine individual depth of\nexperience and competence in a particular chosen engineering specialty, and a\nstrong background in the basic and engineering sciences, with laboratory and\ndesign, culminating in a capstone design experience. It strives to develop\nprofessional independence, creativity, leadership, and the capacity for\ncontinuing professional and intellectual growth.\n\nThe first year of the four-year course of study leading to a Bachelor of\nScience degree is common for all students of the Institute, although first-\nyear elective subjects are available as an introduction to various aspects of\nengineering and applied science. At the end of the first year, students who\nelect the EAS option are assigned advisers as close to their expressed field\nof interest as possible, and together with their advisers they develop\nprograms of study for the next three years. Beyond the Institute-wide\nrequirements of physics, mathematics, and humanities, the EAS option requires\none year of applied and computational mathematics and a prescribed number of\nunits selected from a wide variety of engineering and applied science courses.\nEngineering design (synthesis), as distinct from analysis, is considered an\nessential part of every engineer\u2019s capability. Advisers will expect students\nto select a sufficient number of courses that place emphasis on design.\n\nAny student in the EAS option whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at\nthe end of the academic year in the subjects listed in the option requirements\nmay be refused permission to continue to work in the EAS option.\n\n##  EAS Option Requirements\n\nStudents who have elected the EAS option must either choose one of the\napproved areas of concentration (see item 7 below), or by the end of the third\nterm of the sophomore year submit a written proposed customized course of\nstudy and obtain approval for it from the EAS option representative.\n\nThe course of study must include each of the following elements:\n\n  1. Fulfillment of core requirements in differential equations (Ma2 or equivalent); Probability and Statistics (Ma 3 or equivalent); Waves (Ph2a, Ph12a or equivalent), Quantum Mechanics (Ph 2b, Ph 12b, Ch 21a or equivalent); Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics (Ph 2c, Ph 12c, ChE 63, ME 11, Ch 21c or equivalent);\n  2. Demonstration of computer programming competency by taking CS 1, or by taking an approved alternative course, or by passing a placement exam administered by the computer science option by first term of sophomore year.\n    1. 27 units of advanced EAS courses with the prefixes Ae, ACM, AM, APh, CE, CS, CDS, EE, ESE, MS, or ME; and\n    2. 27 additional units of either advanced EAS courses or advanced science courses offered by the BBE, CCE, GPS, or PMA divisions.\n    3. 9 units of laboratory courses taken from the following list: APh 77 bc, Ae/APh 104 bc, CE 180, CS/CNS 171,174, EE 45, 53, EE 90, EE 91, MS 90, MS 125, ME 72 ab, ME 50 ab, ME 90 bc; and\n    4. 9 units of additional laboratory courses either from the list in 3a or from EAS courses with the word \u201dlaboratory\u201d in the title, but excluding those courses for which first-year laboratory credit is allowed.\n  3. ACM 95 ab or Ma 108 abc or Ma 109 abc. None of these course sequences may be taken pass/fail.\n  4. SEC 10 or equivalent; one of SEC 11, SEC 12, or SEC 13 or equivalent.\n  5. Courses used to satisfy requirements 1\u20135 above must also satisfy a depth requirement, which must be met by a customized schedule of requirements that is rigorous, has both breadth and depth, and that includes a senior thesis or capstone design project, such as, but not restricted to, EE 80 abc, CS 80 abc, ME 90 abc, or two terms ofEE 91 ab. The student must submit a written proposal justifying their course selections, and obtain the approval of, the EAS option representative by the end of the third term of the sophomore year.\n  6. At least 117 units of EAS courses not including those used to satisfy requirements 4, 5, and 6 above.\n  7. The customized schedule of requirements described in 7 shall include a major design experience.\n  8. Passing grades must be earned in at least 486 units, including those listed in requirements 1\u20138 above.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope\n\nThe option in English provides students with a broad and intensive education\nin the rich traditions of literature in English from the Middle Ages to the\npresent day, with a particular emphasis on British and American writing. The\nEnglish faculty expects undergraduate option students to become familiar with\na range of literary forms, genres, and styles of expression; to understand how\nauthors and texts can be shaped by historical contexts; to appreciate\ndifferences in literary expression across time periods and national\ntraditions; to develop critical reading skills through analysis and\ninterpretation of literary texts; and to become effective writers in matters\nof style, organization, and interpretive argument.\n\nDuring the senior year, and typically in the first two terms, English option\nstudents enroll in En 99 ab (Senior Tutorial for English Majors) with a\nfaculty member chosen by mutual agreement. The first part of this sequence\nmust begin in fall term. The Senior Tutorial introduces students to advanced\nmethods in literary research and analysis and provides an important means for\nassessing the progress of English option students in the rigorous study of\nliterary texts and contexts. Students research, write, and revise a 25-30 page\npaper on a topic in British or American literature; En 99 a is primarily a\nresearch term, and En 99 b is primarily a writing term. Both terms involve\nregular tutorial consultation with the faculty instructor. English option\nstudents should begin considering a senior thesis topic in the third term of\ntheir junior year in consultation with the option representative or option\nadviser.\n\nIn addition to the Senior Tutorial, the English option requires nine courses.\nAll English option students are assigned an adviser who will help select\ncourses best suited to their needs and interests, including where appropriate\na limited number of courses in related fields such as history, visual culture,\ncreative writing, and literature other than British and American. Students\nshould consult their option adviser in advance of registration for each term.\nAll courses counted toward the option must be taken for grades except for a\nfirst-year humanities course in English when taken in the first two quarters\nof a first-year student\u2019s first year.\n\nMost students pursue English as a second option. The emphasis on writing and\non critical reading helps students develop communication skills that can\nenhance their careers as scientists, engineers, and medical professionals. The\nEnglish option also provides excellent preparation for those seeking careers\nin law, business, and administration, and in any field that involves extensive\ncommunication.\n\n##  En Option Requirements\n\n  1. En 99 ab.\n  2. 81 additional units of English courses numbered 99 and above. Up to nine units of first-year humanities in English (courses cross-listed Hum/En numbered 60 or below) and/or up to nine units of En 98 may be substituted for up to 18 of the remaining English units. Students may also substitute courses in foreign literature (in the original or in translation) and/or, with authorization of the adviser, related humanities courses numbered above 99, for up to 18 of the remaining English units. Students may also substitute either En 85 or 86, courses in foreign literature (in the original or in translation), and/or, with authorization of the adviser, related humanities courses numbered above 99, for up to 18 of the remaining English units.\n  3. 54 additional units of science, mathematics, and engineering courses. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed as satisfying the introductory laboratory requirement or by a course with a number less than 10.\n  4. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including the courses listed above.\n\n###  English Minor Requirements\n\nThe English minor is designed for students who want to pursue concentrated\nstudy in English and/or American literature, without the extensive course work\nand the senior thesis required by the English option.\n\nEnglish minors must take 72 units of English courses. These units may include\none first-year humanities course; they may also include one directed reading\ncourse (En 98). Students wishing to do a minor in English must declare a minor\nwith the English option representative. All courses to be counted toward the\noption in English must be taken for grades except for a first-year humanities\ncourse in English when taken in the first two quarters of a first-year\nstudent's first year. Students completing the English minor requirements will\nhave the phrase \u201dminor in English\u201d added to their transcripts.\n\n  1. 72 units of English courses numbered 99 or above.\n  2. Nine units of first-year humanities in English (courses cross-listed Hum/En numbered 60 or below) may be substitute for any nine of the 72 units required for the minor.\n  3. Nine units of En 98 may be substituted for any nine of the 72 units required for the minor.\n  4. Nine units of En 85 or 86 may be substituted for any nine of the 72 units required for the minor.\n\nCourses used to complete the English minor may not be used to satisfy the\nrequirements of another option or minor. However, these courses may be used to\nsatisfy core Institute requirements in the humanities.\n\n"

The\ntwo tracks share a sophomore year that continues the Core Curriculum\u2019s\ntraining in mathematics and physics. Each track requires a laboratory\ncomponent and training in data analysis and statistics. All ESE majors must\ntake three broad-based classes (ESE 101, 102, and 103 ) providing\nintroductions to atmospheric and oceanic physics as well as marine and\nterrestrial biogeochemistry. The physics and chemistry tracks initially\nparallel their respective majors in the core disciplines. However, there are\nfewer required classes in the ESE major to enable students to design a\ncurriculum that emphasizes the environmental sciences, after training in a\ncore discipline.

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope\n\nThe aim of the undergraduate program is to provide thorough training in the\ngeological and planetary sciences and, wherever possible, to integrate these\nstudies with courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology taken\nduring the student\u2019s earlier years at the Institute. Active involvement in\nresearch, particularly during the summer, is encouraged. For geologists, field\nwork is important because it provides first hand experience with geological\nphenomena that is challenging to completely explain or to fully understand\nsolely from classroom or laboratory treatment. We offer a major in Geological\nand Planetary Sciences (GPS) that involves a number of core courses and\nvarious electives. We also provide information below on more focused tracks in\neach of the options, such that you can be awarded a major in GPS with a stated\ntrack on the transcript. These tracks are offered in geology, geobiology,\ngeochemistry, geophysics, and planetary science. Electives permit students to\nfollow lines of special interest in related scientific and engineering fields.\nThose who do well in the basic sciences and at the same time have a compelling\ncuriosity about the earth, climate, and the other planets are likely to find\nthese options of interest, especially if they enjoy grappling with complex,\ninterdisciplinary problems. Many students majoring in the earth and planetary\nsciences pursue further training at the graduate level, while others take jobs\nthat leverage a strong background in earth science including opportunities in\nsustainability, risk assessment, and climate policy.\n\nFor those students with an interest in geobiology, there are options to either\nbe associated with the Biology and Biological Engineering or the GPS division.\nThis association formally affects some of the course requirements that are\nneeded to satisfy the undergraduate degree. Additionally, a students\u2019\naffiliation with one division or another is likely to significantly shape\ntheir choice of elective courses and potentially research opportunities. We\nsuggest that any interested students discuss this choice with their adviser\nand/or contact the option representative in the GPS geobiology option.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that students start the GPS major with the Ge 11\nsequence in the sophomore year. Because Ge 120 ab may not be offered every\nyear, students in the geology track may also need to take Ge 106 and Ge 120 a\nin winter and spring term of their sophomore year in order to prepare for Ge\n120 b the following summer.\n\nSuggestions of elective courses that fulfill degree requirements are listed\nbelow, and include some 200-level courses. While these courses are primarily\nintended for graduate students, advanced undergraduates may enroll with\npermission of the instructor.\n\n###  GPS Double Majors\n\nFor students simultaneously pursuing a degree in a second option, courses\ntaken as required courses for that option can also be counted as Ge electives\nwhere appropriate. However, courses that count toward the electives\nrequirement in the other option cannot simultaneously be counted toward\nsatisfying the elective requirement in GPS.\n\n##  GPS Undergraduate Degree Requirements\n\nThe following core courses are required for all GPS option tracks:\n\n  1. Ge 1 or Ge 11a\n  2. Ge 11a, 11b, 11c, 11d\n  3. A writing class, (at least three units)\n  4. An oral presentation class (at least three units)\n  5. Ma 2\n  6. Ma 3 or Ge/Ay 117\n  7. Ph 2a or Ph 12a\n  8. One of: Ph 2b, Ph 12b, Ph 2c, Ph 12c\n\nCourses that cover both writing and presentation, e.g. En/Wr 84, that are at\nleast 6 units may be counted towards requirements (3) and (4) above. Students\nthat elect to use Ge 11a for requirement (1) may substitute an elective for Ge\n11a in requirement (2). Assuming 3 units each for requirements (3) and (4),\nthe total core requirements totals 87 units; a writing course such as En/Wr 84\n(9 units) would increase this to 90 units.\n\n##  The GPS Major (no special track)\n\nIn addition to the core requirements stated above, the student may design a\ncourse of study, in consultation with their adviser, that satisfies the\nfollowing requirements:\n\n63 units of advanced Science, Mathematics, or Engineering outside GPS.\n\n72 units of GPS elective coursework. The combination of the core requirements\nand the 135 units of GPS major requirements should total no less than 222\nunits.\n\n###  Geology Track\n\nIn addition to the core requirements stated above, a GPS major with a Geology\ntrack must include:\n\n  1. Either ACM 95ab or a full-year chemistry sequence, Ch 41abc or Ch 21abc\n  2. Ge 106\n  3. Ge 114 ab\n  4. Ge 115 ab\n  5. Ge 120 a\n  6. Ge 112 or Ge/ESE 125\n  7. An external geology field camp during the summer following sophomore or junior year, chosen in consultation with advisor, and with the student\u2019s participation funded by Caltech.\n  8. Additional elective courses in Ge or ESE to bring the total number of units to 220, including the core classes.\n\n**Typical Course Schedules**\n\n|  |  _Units per term_  \n---|---|---  \n|  |  _1st_ |  _2nd_ |  _3rd_  \n_Second Year_  \nMa 2 & 3  |  Sophomore mathematics  |  9  |  9  |  \\-   \nPh 2 a & c  |  Sophomore physics  |  9  |  \\-  |  9   \nGe 11 abc  |  Intro.

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope\n\nStudents who choose the history option will learn how to _do_ history\u2014how to\nthink critically about past societies and their development, how to read\nevidence closely, and how to express arguments in writing. With the guidance\nof a faculty adviser in history, students taking the option will explore the\nrange of human experience in the realms of politics, culture, religion, and\neconomics, as well as science and technology. They will learn both to\nchallenge and revise existing historical narratives and question their own\nideas and assumptions about the past. Students will develop the writing skills\nthat will enable them to use historical sources to make effective arguments,\nand they will receive extensive feedback on their writing from their adviser\nand from other faculty members.\n\nThe history option thus provides science and engineering students with an\nimportant supplement to the scientific training and technical skills they\nacquire in other courses and options. It will help them to understand the\nworld of human beings and human behavior outside of science with which they\nwill interact and which their scientific work will affect; to set themselves\nand their work as scientists and engineers in this wider context; and to\ncommunicate what they are doing to a wider public as well as to their\ncolleagues. In addition, it offers excellent preparation for careers in\nbusiness, administration, law, journalism, or public affairs, as well as a\nsolid foundation for graduate work in history.\n\nHistory majors must take at least 99 units of history courses (which may\ninclude a first-year humanities course in history) during their four years as\nundergraduates. Of these, 27 must be in the senior tutorial (H 99 abc). All\ncourses to be counted toward the history option must be taken for grades\nexcept for a first-year humanities course in history when taken in the first\ntwo quarters of a first-year student\u2019s first year. History majors may also\nchoose to take one term of H 98, an individual program of directed reading\nthat will allow students to explore areas of history not covered by regular\ncourses.\n\nEach history major will choose an area of concentration in consultation with\ntheir adviser and the history option representative. These areas might\ninclude, but are not restricted to, fields such as ancient history, medieval\nEurope, early-modern Europe, modern Europe, Russian history, American history\npre- 1865, American history post-1865, early-modern history of science, modern\nhistory of science, or economic history. A student must take 63 units of\ncourses in this area; 27 of these units must be in the senior tutorial H 99\nabc.\n\nIn the senior tutorial, students will have the opportunity over the course of\nthree terms to explore in depth an historical subject of particular interest\nto them, while working one-on-one with a member of the history faculty. They\nwill learn how to carry out historical research, in libraries as well as on-\nline, and engage critically with both primary and secondary historical\nsources. Finally, they will learn, under the direct supervision of their\nfaculty mentor, to organize and to write an extensive research paper, of at\nleast 30 pages, that makes an original, clear and persuasive scholarly\nargument. In H 99a, students will carry out general research in their area of\ninterest, and identify the specific topic on which they wish to write. In H\n99b they will learn to frame a research question, carry out independently the\nnecessary research to answer it, and generate an outline of their paper. In H\n99c they will write and revise their paper in response to feedback from their\nfaculty mentor.\n\nEach student must take the remaining 36 units of history required by the\noption in areas other than the area of concentration, again defined in\nconsultation with their adviser and the history option representative. These\nareas may include not only fields within the discipline of history proper, but\nalso useful cognate fields such as economics, political science, anthropology,\nlaw, English, or a foreign language.\n\nA student considering the history option when they come to Caltech will be\nwell advised to take a first-year humanities course in history (courses cross-\nlisted Hum/H numbered 60 or below). In the sophomore year, the student should\ntake upper-level history courses, but this is also a good time to pursue the\nstudy of English or philosophy, to begin or continue a foreign language, and\nto do introductory work in the social sciences. A student will normally make a\ncommitment to an area of concentration early in the junior year. At the\nbeginning of the senior year, a history major will enroll in H 99 abc with a\nfaculty member in their area of concentration.\n\n##  H Option Requirements\n\n  1. H 99 abc.\n  2. 72 additional units of history courses numbered 99 or above. Up to nine units of first-year humanities in history (courses cross-listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below) and/or up to nine units of H 98 may be substituted for up to 18 of these units.\n  3. 63 of the total history units, including H 99 abc, must be in an area of concentration, as defined in consultation with the student\u2019s adviser and the history option representative.\n  4. 36 of the total history units must be in an area or areas other than the area of concentration, as defined in consultation with the student\u2019s adviser and the history option representative. H 99 abc may not be used to fulfill this requirement.\n  5. 54 additional units of science, mathematics, and engineering courses. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed as satisfying the introductory laboratory requirement or by menu courses.\n  6. Three units of oral communication. En/Wr 84 satisfies this requirement, as do oral communication courses offered by other options.\n  7. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including the courses listed above.\n\nCourses used to complete the history option under categories 1, 2, or 3 above\nmay not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor.  \n\n##  H Minor Requirements\n\nThe history minor is designed for students who want to pursue concentrated\nstudy in history without the extensive course work and the senior thesis\nrequired by the history option.\n\nHistory minors must take 72 units of history courses. These units may include\none first-year humanities course; they may also include one directed reading\ncourse (H 98). All courses to be counted toward the history minor must be\ntaken for grades except for a first-year humanities course in history when\ntaken in the first two quarters of a first-year student\u2019s first year. Students\nwishing to do a minor in history must declare a minor with the history option\nrepresentative. Students completing the history minor requirements will have\nthe phrase \u201dminor in history\u201d added to their transcripts.\n\n  1. 72 units of history courses numbered 99 or above.\n  2. Nine units of first-year humanities in history (courses cross listed Hum/H numbered 60 or below) may be substituted for\n  3. any nine of the 72 units required for the minor.\n  4. Nine units of H 98 may be substituted for any nine of the 72\n  5. units required for the minor.\n\nStudents cannot use history minor requirements to satisfy a different option\nor minor.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope\n\nThe history and philosophy of science option (HPS) provides students the\nopportunity to explore the historical evolution of the sciences and the\nphilosophical perspectives that inform them, as well as the dynamics between\nscience, technology, and other human endeavors.\n\nHPS courses in history help students learn about the origins of experimental\npractice; the social and institutional contexts of science; the origins and\napplications of quantitative methods; specific developments since antiquity in\nphysics, biology, chemistry, geography and cartography, medicine; and\nbiographical and comparative studies in these fields. HPS courses in\nphilosophy deal with issues in causation and explanation; the foundations of\nprobability and statistical inference; and philosophical problems in\nparticular fields such as biology, mathematics, medicine, neuroscience, and\nphysics. In their coursework, students receive regular feedback from the\nfaculty on their research, writing, and presentation skills. They have the\nopportunity to carry out independent research, especially in their thesis\nwork, and present their findings in a seminar setting.\n\nThis option thus aims to give students a broad, basic understanding of how\nscience is practiced and how that practice has changed over time. Students\nlearn to address questions such as: To what extent was the scientific\nrevolution revolutionary? What is a scientific explanation and how do\nscientists go about constructing and justifying one? How have conceptions of\nscientific experimentation changed? What are the ethical issues raised by\nexperimentation with human or animal subjects? How has relativity theory\nchanged our conceptions of space and time? The option is designed to\ncomplement the regular science curriculum at Caltech, offering students the\nopportunity to enlarge upon, and to contextualize, the strong technical skills\nthey acquire in other courses and options.\n\nBecause of its emphasis on essay writing and formulating complex philosophical\nand historical arguments, our curriculum provides training in writing and\ncommunication skills that are increasingly vital today. The HPS option\nprovides excellent preparation for students going into law, business,\nmedicine, science journalism and public affairs, and it also prepares students\nfor graduate work in the history and/or philosophy of science.\n\n##  HPS Option Requirements\n\n  1. Hum/H/HPS 18; HPS 102 ab; HPS/Pl 120; and HPS 103 (one quarter). (HPS 102 b fulfills the Institute science writing requirement.)\n  2. One advanced course in the history of science, chosen from HPS/H offerings with a course number of 98 or higher; one advanced course in philosophy of science, chosen from HPS/Pl offerings with a course number of 98 or higher; and any four courses in HPS. (No more than 9 units of HPS 98 may be counted towards the HPS major.)\n  3. 45 units of courses in science, mathematics, and engineering. This requirement cannot be satisfied by courses listed as satisfying the introductory laboratory requirement or by a course with a number less than 10.\n  4. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including all courses used to satisfy the above requirements.\n\nCourses used to complete the history and philosophy of science option under\ncategories 1, 2, or 3 above may not be used to satisfy the requirements of\nanother option or minor.\n\nWe recommend that students intending to follow the HPS option take Hum/H/HPS\n18, Introduction to History of Science, as one of their first-year humanities\ncourses. Students making the decision to follow this option in their sophomore\nyear should take Hum/H/HPS 18 and HPS/Pl 120, Introduction to Philosophy of\nScience, as early as possible in that year. Students may also enter the option\nin their junior year if they can complete the option\u2019s requirements in time\nfor graduation. Please also note the following:\n\nNot all required courses are offered each term; students should consult the\ncurrent catalog to determine which terms required courses are being offered,\nand should construct their course plan for the year accordingly.\n\nWe encourage students to choose their advanced social science electives from\namong courses that will enlarge their perspective on topics related to HPS\n(for example, Ec 118, Ec/SS 128, Ec 129, Ec 130, PSY 101, PSY 115, PSY 125,\nPSY 130, PS 120, PS 121, PS 122, An 22).\n\nHPS 102ab, the Senior Research Seminar, may be taken in any two consecutive\nterms in the Senior year. Students should coordinate with their HPS adviser in\ndetermining their course schedule.\n\n##  HPS Typical Course Schedule\n\n###  First Year\n\nIt is recommended that students intending to follow the HPS option take\nHum/H/HPS 18 as one of their first-year humanities courses.\n\n|  |  _Units per term_  \n---|---|---  \n|  |  _1st_ |  _2nd_ |  _3rd_  \n_Second Year_  \nHPS 18  1  |  Introduction to History of Science  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nHPS/Pl 120  1  |  Introduction to Philosophy of Science  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \n|  Advanced HPS/history  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \nHPS 103  |  Public Lecture Series  |  1  |  1  |  1   \n|  Menu course  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \nEc 11  \nor PS 12  |  Introductory Social Science  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \n|  Other electives  |  27  |  36  |  27   \n|  **Total** |  **46** |  **46** |  **46**  \n_Third Year_  \nHPS 103  |  Public Lecture Series  |  1  |  1  |  1   \n|  Advanced HPS/history  |  \\-  |  9  |  9   \n|  Advanced HPS/philosophy  |  9  |  9  |  9   \n|  Science, math, engineering  |  9  |  9  |  9   \n|  Advanced social science  2  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \n|  Other electives  |  18  |  18  |  18   \n|  **Total** |  **46** |  **46** |  **46**  \n_Fourth Year_  \nHPS 103  |  Public Lecture Series  |  1  |  1  |  1   \nHPS 102 ab  3  |  Senior Research Seminar  |  \\-  |  12  |  12   \n|  Advanced social science  2  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \n|  Science, math, engineering  |  9  |  9  |  9   \n|  Other electives  |  27  |  18  |  18   \n|  **Total** |  **46** |  **40** |  **40**  \n  \n1 Not all required courses are offered each term; students should consult the\ncurrent catalog to determine which terms required courses are being offered,\nand they should construct their course plan for the year accordingly.\n\n2 We encourage students to choose their advanced social science electives from\namong courses that will enlarge their perspective on topics related to HPS\n(for example, Ec 118, Ec/SS 128, Ec 129, Ec 130, PSY 101, PSY 115, PSY 125,\nPSY 130, PS 120, PS 121, PS 122, An 22)\n\n3 Finally, HPS 102 ab, Senior Research Seminar, may be taken in any two\nconsecutive terms in the senior year. Students should coordinate with their\nHPS adviser in determining their course schedule.\n\n##  HPS Minor Requirements\n\nThe minor in HPS is designed for students who want to pursue concentrated\nstudy in the field without the extensive course work and the senior thesis\nrequired by the HPS option.\n\nHPS minors must complete 72 units of HPS courses. First-year Humanities\ncourses other than Hum/H/HPS 18 may not be counted towards an HPS minor.\nStudents wishing to do a minor in HPS must declare a minor with the HPS option\nrepresentative. Those completing the HPS minor requirements will have the\nphrase \u201dminor in History and Philosophy of Science\u201d added to their\ntranscripts.\n\n  1. 72 units of HPS courses numbered 99 or above.\n  2. 9 units of HPS 98 may be substituted for any 9 of the 72 unit required for the minor.\n  3. 9 units of Hum/H/HPS 18 may be substituted for any 9 of the 72 units required for the minor.\n\nStudents cannot use HPS minor requirements to satisfy a different option or\nminor.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope\n\nThe information and data sciences are concerned with the acquisition, storage,\ncommunication, processing, and analysis of data. These intellectual activities\nhave a long history, and Caltech has traditionally occupied a position of\nstrength with faculty spread out across applied mathematics, electrical\nengineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, astronomy, economics, and\nmany others disciplines. In the last decade, there has been a rapid increase\nin the rate at which data are acquired with the objective of extracting\nactionable knowledge\u2014in the form of scientific models and predictions,\nbusiness decisions, and public policies. From a technological perspective,\nthis rapid increase in the availability of data creates numerous challenges in\nacquisition, storage, and subsequent analysis. More fundamentally, humans\ncannot deal with such a volume of data directly, and it is increasingly\nessential that we automate the pipeline of information processing and\nanalysis. All areas of human endeavor are affected: science, medicine,\nengineering, manufacturing, logistics, the media, entertainment. The range of\nscenarios that concern a scientist in this domain are very broad\u2014from\nsituations in which the available data are nearly infinite (big data), to\nthose in which the data are sparse and precious; from situations in which\ncomputation is, for all practical purposes, an infinite resource to those in\nwhich it is critical to respond rapidly and computation must thus be treated\nas a precious resource; from situations in which the data are all available at\nonce to those in which they are presented as a stream.\n\nAs such, the information and data sciences now draw not just upon traditional\nareas spanning computer science, applied mathematics, and electrical\nengineering\u2014signal processing, information and communication theory, control\nand decision theory, probability and statistics, algorithms\u2014but also a range\nof new contemporary topics such as machine learning, network science,\ndistributed systems, and neuroscience. The result is an area that is new,\nfundamentally different that related areas like computer science and\nstatistics, and that is crucial to modern applications in the physical\nsciences, social sciences, and engineering.\n\nThe Information and Data Sciences (IDS) option is unabashedly mathematical,\nfocusing on the foundations of the information and data sciences, across its\nroots in probability, statistics, linear algebra, and signal processing. These\nfields all contribute crucial components of data science today. Further, it\ntakes advantage of the interdisciplinary nature of Caltech by including a\nrequired set of application courses where students will learn about how data\ntouches science and engineering broadly. The flexibility provided by this\nsequence allows students to see data science in action in biology, economics,\nchemistry, and beyond.\n\nIn addition to a major, the IDS option offers a minor that focuses on the\nmathematical foundations of the information and data sciences but recognizes\nthe fact that many students in other majors across campus have a need to\nsupplement their options with practical training in data science.\n\n##  IDS Option Requirements\n\n  1. Computer Science Fundamentals. CS 1 or CS 1X; CS 2; CS 21 or Ma/CS 6c; and CS 38.\n  2. Mathematical Fundamentals. Ma 2; Ma 3 or Ma/ACM/IDS 140a; Ma 108a; (CS13 or Ma/CS 6a or Ma 121a); (Ma/CS 6b or Ma 121b). The analytical tracks of Ma1bc are strongly recommended.\n  3. Scientific Fundamentals. 18 units selected from the following courses: BE/Bi 25, BE 153, Bi 8, Bi 9, Bi 117, Ch 21abc, Ch 24, Ch 25, Ch 41abc, Ph 2abc, or Ph 12abc. Advanced 100+ courses in Bi, Ch, or Ph with strong scientific component can be used to satisfy this requirement with approval from the option representative, but cannot simultaneously be used to satisfy the \u201cApplications Elective\u201d requirement or the \u201cAdvanced Electives\u201d requirement.\n  4. Communication Fundamentals. SEC 10; and one of SEC 11-13.\n  5. Information and Data Science Core Requirements.\n    1. Linear Algebra: ACM/IDS 104; ACM 106a.\n    2.

Other courses that include applications of data science may be substituted with approval from the option representative. Courses used to fulfill this requirement may not also be used to fill the any requirement above\n  7. Advanced Electives. At least 54 units from the following list: IDS courses numbered 100 or above, CS/CNS/EE 156ab, ACM 106b, ACM 95/100ab, CMS/ACM/EE 122, CS 115, Ma 112 ab. Courses used to fulfill this requirement may not also be used to fill the any requirement above.\n\nCourses used to fulfill requirements in the \u201cApplications of Data Science\u201d and\n\u201cAdvanced Electives\u201d requirements cannot be used to fulfill the institute\nhumanities and social sciences requirements.\n\nUnits used to fulfill the Institute Core requirements do not count toward any\nof the option requirements. Pass/fail grading cannot be elected for courses\ntaken to satisfy option requirements. Passing grades must be earned in total\nof 486 units, including all courses used to satisfy the above requirements.\n\n###  IDS Double Majors\n\nStudents interested in simultaneously pursuing a degree in a second option\nmust fulfill all the requirements of the Information and Data Sciences option.\nCourses may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements in both options.\nHowever, it is required that students have at least 54 units of \u201dAdvanced\nElectives\u201d and 18 units of \u201dApplications of Data Science\u201d that are not\nsimultaneously used for fulfilling a requirement of the second option, i.e.,\nthe requirements of the Advanced Electives and the Applications of Data\nScience sections must be fulfilled using courses that are not simultaneously\nused for fulfilling a requirement of the second option. Any proposal to\nreplace these courses must be discussed with the option administrator. To\nenroll in the program, the student should meet and discuss their plans with\nthe option representative. In general, approval is contingent on good academic\nperformance by the student and demonstrated ability for handling the heavier\ncourse load.\n\n##  IDS Typical Course Schedule\n\n|  |  _Units per term_  \n---|---|---  \n|  |  _1st_ |  _2nd_ |  _3rd_  \n_Second Year_  \nCS 1  |  Intro. to Computer Programming  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nCS 2  |  Intro. to Programming Methods  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \nCS 38  |  Algorithms  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \nMa 2  |  Differential Equations  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nMa 3  |  Intro. to Probability and Statistics  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \nMa/CS 6 ab  |  Intro. to Discrete Methods  |  9  |  9  |  \\-   \nACM/IDS 104  |  Applied Linear Algebra  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \n|  HSS Electives  |  9  |  9  |  9   \n|  Scientific Fundamentals  |  \\-  |  9  |  9   \n|  Other Electives  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \n|  **Total** |  **45** |  **45** |  **36**  \n_Third Year_  \nSEC 10  |  Technical Seminar Presentations  |  \\-  |  3  |  \\-   \nCMS/CS/CNS/EE/IDS 155  |  Machine Learning & Data Mining  |  \\-  |  12  |  \\-   \nOne of  \nSEC 11-13  |  Written Communication  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  3   \nMa 108 a  |  Classical Analysis  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nEE/IDS 111  |  Signal-Processing Systems and Transforms  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \nIDS/ACM/CS 157  |  Statistical Inference  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \nACM/EE/IDS 116  |  Intro. to Probability Models  |  9  |  \\-  |  \\-   \n|  HSS Electives  |  9  |  9  |  9   \n|  Advanced Electives  |  9  |  9  |  9   \n|  Applications Electives  |  \\-  |  9  |  \\-   \n|  Other Electives  |  \\-  |  \\-  |  9   \n|  **Total** |  **45** |  **42** |  **39**  \n_Fourth Year_  \nACM/EE 106 a  |  Intro.

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope\n\nThe Interdisciplinary Studies Program (ISP) is an undergraduate option that\nallows the student to create their own scholastic requirements, under faculty\nsupervision, and to pursue positive educational goals that cannot be achieved\nin any of the other available options. A student\u2019s program may include regular\nCaltech courses, research courses, courses at other schools, and\ninterdisciplinary study courses (item 5, next page). In scope and depth, the\nprogram must be comparable to a normal undergraduate program, but it need not\ninclude all of the specific courses or groups of courses listed in the\nformulated Institute option requirements for undergraduates.\n\nThe Curriculum Committee, a standing committee of the faculty, has overall\nresponsibility for the program. In addition, each student has their own\ncommittee of at least two advisers, two of whom must be professorial faculty.\nApplication material may be obtained at the dean of undergraduate students\u2019\noffice or website.\n\n##  ISP Administrative Procedures and Guidelines\n\n  1. An interested student must recruit at least two professorial faculty members representing at least two different degree-granting options to serve as the ISP faculty committee. Each member of the faculty committee must provide a letter that includes:\n    1. Faculty name and department/division, and the discipline they \u201crepresent\u201d within the proposed ISP.\n    2. Faculty\u2019s assessment of the student\u2019s ISP proposal, including the proposed degree title, as it relates to that faculty\u2019s discipline.\n    3. Faculty assessment of whether the student could choose an existing degree-granting option with some acceptable accommodations, rather than create an ISP. That is, does this ISP enable something that could not be accomplished in a single option or major/minor combination.\n  2. Send the ISP proposal (cover sheet, proposed curriculum, and the aforementioned letters from professorial faculty advisers to the dean of undergraduate students for review and approval.\n  3. The dean of undergraduate students sends the ISP petition to the Curriculum Committee for review and final approval. This contract includes the agreed-upon content of the student\u2019s program and the methods for ascertaining satisfactory progress for those parts of the student\u2019s program that are not standard Institute courses. This contract may of course be amended, but any amendments must be approved by the committee of two and the Curriculum Committee. Copies of each student\u2019s contract and of all amendments thereto, along with all ISP records for each student and their transcript, are kept in the permanent files of the Registrar\u2019s Office. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units.\n  4. The progress of each student in the ISP is monitored each quarter by the registrar, and any deviations from the terms of the contract are reported to the chair of the Curriculum Committee. Standards for acceptable progress and for satisfactory completion of the terms of the contract are the responsibility of the Curriculum Committee. When the Committee is satisfied that the terms of the contract have been fulfilled by the student, it recommends the student to the faculty for graduation.\n  5. A plan of study may include special ISP courses to accommodate individual programs of study or special research that falls outside ordinary course offerings. In order that credit be received for an ISP course, a written course contract specifying the work to be accomplished, time schedule for progress reports and completed work, units of credit, and form of grading must be agreed upon by the instructor, the student, and the committee of two, and submitted to the registrar prior to initiating the work in the course. ISP courses are recorded on the student\u2019s transcript in the same manner as are other Caltech courses.\n  6. ISPs are intended for multiyear programs. Accordingly, the Curriculum Committee urges students contemplating an ISP to submit their petition during their second year and will not normally consider such petitions any later than the first term of the student\u2019s third year.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope\n\nThe aim of the Materials Science option is to prepare students for research,\nprofessional practice, or advanced study in a rapidly advancing\ninterdisciplinary field, focusing on the relationships between the properties\nof materials and their internal structure and how this structure can be\ncontrolled. The program builds on the core curriculum to develop analytical\ncompetence and use it for individualized research, culminating in a one-year\nsenior thesis. Materials Science students develop professional independence,\ncreativity, leadership, and the skills for continuing professional and\nintellectual growth. The first year of the four-year course of study leading\nto a Bachelor of Science degree is common for all students of the Institute,\nalthough first-year elective subjects are available as an introduction to\nvarious aspects of engineering and applied science. At the end of the first\nyear, students who elect the Materials Science option are assigned advisers\nappropriate for their expressed field of interest. Together with their\nadvisers, they develop programs of study for the next three years. Beyond the\nInstitute-wide requirements of physics, mathematics, and humanities, the\nMaterials Science option requires one year of applied and computational\nmathematics and a prescribed number of units selected from a wide variety of\ncourses in science and engineering. An undergraduate thesis is an essential\npart of the academic program. Any student in the Materials Science option\nwhose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in\nthe subjects listed in the option requirements may be refused permission to\ncontinue to work in the Materials Science option.\n\n##  MS Option Requirements\n\n  1.

Math\nstudents go well beyond the basics to study the structures of algebra,\nanalysis and geometry, as well as the rudiments of combinatorics and set\ntheory. Students learn to write coherent and complete proofs of various\nassertions, to work out non-trivial examples and to use computational tools.\n\nThe schedule of courses in the undergraduate mathematics option is flexible.\nIt enables students to adapt their programs to their needs and mathematical\ninterests and gives them the opportunity to become familiar with creative\nmathematics early in their careers. Some students go to use their background\nin mathematics as an entry to other fields, such as physics, computer science,\nstatistics, economics, business, finance, medicine and law.\n\nFirst-year students considering majoring in mathematics should be aware that\nthe department strongly recommends taking the analytical track of Ma 1 bc. Any\nstudent whose grade-point average is less than 1.9 at the end of the academic\nyear, in the subjects under mathematics and applied and computational\nmathematics may be refused permission to continue work in the mathematics\noptions.\n\n##  Ma Option Requirements\n\n  1.

Specifically, the program builds\non Caltech\u2019s core curriculum to combine the individual depth of experience and\ncompetence in a particular chosen mechanical engineering specialty with a\nstrong background in the basic and engineering sciences. It maintains a\nbalance between classroom lectures and laboratory and design experience and\nemphasizes the problem-formulation and solving skills that are essential to\nany engineering discipline. The program also strives to develop in each\nstudent self-reliance, creativity, leadership, professional ethics, and the\ncapacity for continuing professional and intellectual growth. For interested\nstudents, there are opportunities to conduct research with a faculty member.\n\nThe outcome of the undergraduate program is to prepare the student to build on\na fundamental education in physics, mathematics, chemistry, and biology and to\napply those principles to the solution of open-ended engineering problems; to\ndesign, analyze, measure, and evaluate fluid, thermal, and mechanical systems;\nto work effectively as part of a team; to communicate effectively; to apply\nethical considerations; and to understand the broader impacts of engineering\ndevelopments, including societal, cultural and environmental concerns.\n\nMechanical engineering is the branch of engineering that is generally\nconcerned with understanding forces and motion, and their application to\nsolving problems of interest to society. The field includes aspects of\nthermodynamics, fluid and solid mechanics, mechanisms, materials, and energy\nconversion and transfer, and involves the application of physics, mathematics,\nchemistry, and, increasingly, biology and computer science. Importantly, the\nfield also emphasizes the process of formulation, design, optimization,\nmanufacture, and control of new systems and devices.\n\nTechnical developments in the last decade have established the importance of\ninterdisciplinary engineering and science, and as a result, new technical\ndisciplines within mechanical engineering have emerged. These new areas build\non an understanding of the fundamental behavior of physical systems; however,\nthe focus of this work is on the interfaces between traditional disciplines.\nExamples of the new disciplines include micro- and nano-mechanical systems,\nsimulation, and synthesis, integrated complex distributed systems, and\nbiological engineering.\n\nMechanical engineers can be found in many fields, including automotive,\naerospace, materials processing and development, power production, consumer\nproducts, robotics and automation, semiconductor processing, and\ninstrumentation. Mechanical engineering can also be the starting point for\ncareers in bioengineering, environmental and aeronautical engineering,\nfinance, and business management.\n\nThe mechanical engineering undergraduate option is accredited by the\nEngineering Accreditation Commission of ABET,\n[www.abet.org](http://www.abet.org), under the General Criteria and the\nMechanical Engineering Program Criteria.\n\nAt the end of the first year, students who elect the Mechanical Engineering\nOption are assigned advisers as close to their expressed field of interest as\npossible, and together they develop programs of study for the next three\nyears.\n\nA student whose interests relate to mechanical engineering, but who wishes to\npursue a broader course of study than that allowed by the requirements below,\nmay elect the Engineering and Applied Science Option.\n\nAttention is called to the fact that any student whose grade-point average is\nless than 1.9 at the end of the academic year in the required courses listed\nbelow may be refused permission to continue work in this option.\n\n##  ME Option Requirements\n\n  1. Technical communication: SEC 10 and one of SEC 11, SEC 12, or SEC 13.\n  2.

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope\n\nThe philosophy option provides students with a broad education in philosophy\nthat is designed to complement the scientific curriculum at Caltech.\nPhilosophy majors will be expected to learn about some of the major figures\nand movements in the history of philosophy, and to learn about contemporary\nphilosophical debates. The philosophy option also aims to provide students\nwith new perspectives on the material they learn in their science courses, and\nto enable them to bring their technical skills and scientific learning to\ntraditional problems in philosophy.\n\nThe philosophy curriculum will help students to acquire the basic tools of\nphilosophical analysis: the ability to read and interpret philosophical texts;\nthe ability to identify strengths and weaknesses of philosophical arguments;\nthe ability to develop well-reasoned defenses of philosophical positions; and\nthe ability to anticipate objections to one\u2019s own views. In addition, the\nphilosophy option will train students to express themselves clearly and\nconcisely in both writing and speaking. These critical thinking and\ncommunication skills provide an excellent foundation for any intellectual\nendeavor, and are critical to those pursuing careers in fields such as law,\nbusiness, medicine, and scientific research.\n\nThe courses in the philosophy option concentrate in four major areas:\nphilosophy of science; philosophy of mind, brain, and behavior; history of\nphilosophy; and ethics. In their coursework, students will have the\nopportunity to discuss and debate philosophical issues in small groups, and\nwill learn how to offer and receive constructive criticism. They will also\nreceive detailed feedback on their persuasive writing from several different\nmembers of the philosophy faculty.\n\nIn their senior thesis, philosophy majors will have the opportunity to pursue\nmore intensive research in one particular area of philosophy, and to sustain\nan argument on a larger scale, while working one-on-one with a member of the\nphilosophy faculty. This will provide interested students with a solid\nfoundation for graduate work in philosophy and related fields.\n\nPhilosophy majors must take at least 99 units of philosophy courses during\ntheir four years as undergraduates. These must include 18 units of Pl 90 ab,\nto be taken in any two consecutive terms in the senior year. The 99 units may\ninclude nine units of first-year humanities in philosophy (courses cross-\nlisted Hum/Pl numbered 60 or below), nine units of Pl 98, and up to 18 units\nof study in related disciplines.\n\nDepending on their interests, philosophy majors may be required by the option\nrepresentative or their advisers to take up to 18 units in one or more related\nareas. For example, students writing on political philosophy or philosophy of\nneuroscience will be expected to have the appropriate political science or\nneuroscience background. Students whose primary interest lies in the\nphilosophy of science\u2014particularly in the philosophy of specific sciences such\nas physics or biology\u2014will have their intellectual interests best served by\ntaking classes in both the history and philosophy of science. Such students\nare encouraged to pursue the HPS option; or, if they choose the philosophy\noption, they may be required to take some history of science courses as part\nof their 99-unit requirement.\n\nStudents considering the philosophy option will be well advised to take a\nfirst-year humanities course in philosophy. From the sophomore year onward,\nthey should plan on taking one philosophy course per term, culminating in two\nterms of Pl 90 ab in the senior year. Students in Pl 90 ab work with a faculty\nadviser to write a 10,000- to 12,000-word paper on a topic of mutual interest.\nSenior theses are expected to be of a high standard and to form the basis of\nstudents\u2019 applications to graduate study in philosophy, should they so desire.\nWith the exception of Pl 98 and courses taken during the first two quarters of\nthe first-year student\u2019s first year, all courses to be counted toward the\nphilosophy option must be taken for grades unless special permission is\ngranted by the option representative.\n\n##  PI Option Requirements\n\n  1. Pl 90 ab.\n  2. 63 units of advanced philosophy courses, numbered 99 or above. Up to nine units of first-year humanities in philosophy (courses cross-listed Hum/Pl numbered 60 or below) and/or up to nine units of Pl 98 may be substituted for up to 18 of these advanced units.\n  3. 18 units of advanced philosophy courses numbered 99 or above, or advanced non-philosophy courses that are closely related to the student\u2019s area(s) of philosophical interest. (Students wishing to count non-philosophy courses toward their option requirements must obtain prior approval from the philosophy option representative or their adviser. Students will normally not be permitted to satisfy this requirement with core courses.)\n  4. 54 units of science, mathematics, and engineering courses in addition to the core. This requirement cannot be satisfied by core or menu courses, or by courses listed as satisfying the introductory laboratory requirement. Students are strongly encouraged to choose their additional courses in areas that complement their philosophy studies.\n  5. Three units of oral communication. En 84 satisfies this requirement, as do oral communication courses offered by other options.\n  6. Passing grades must be earned in a total of 486 units, including the courses listed above.\n\nCourses used to complete the philosophy option under categories 1, 2, or 3\nabove may not be used to satisfy the requirements of another option or minor.\n\n##  PI Minor Requirements\n\nThe minor in philosophy is designed for students who want to pursue\nconcentrated study in philosophy without the extensive course work and the\nsenior thesis required by the philosophy option.\n\nPhilosophy minors must complete 72 units of philosophy courses. Students\nwishing to do a minor in philosophy must declare a minor with the philosophy\noption representative. Students completing the philosophy minor requirements\nwill have the phrase \u201dminor in philosophy\u201d added to their transcripts. With\nthe exception of Pl 98 and courses taken during the first two semesters of a\nfirst-year student\u2019s first year, all courses to be counted toward the\nphilosophy option or minor must be taken for grades unless special permission\nis granted by the option representative.\n\n  1. 72 units of philosophy courses numbered 99 or above.\n  2. Nine units of Pl 98 may be substituted for any nine units of the 72 required for the minor.\n  3. Nine units of first-year humanities in philosophy (courses cross-listed Hum/Pl numbered 60 or below) may be substituted for any nine units of the 72 required for the minor.\n\nCourses used to complete the philosophy minor may not be used to satisfy the\nrequirements of another option or minor.\n\n"

Students completing the robotics minor\nrequirements will have the phrase \u201cminor in robotics\u201d added to their\ntranscripts. The minor is a collaboration between the CMS, MCE, and EE\ndepartments in EAS.\n\nRobotics, most generally, is an interdisciplinary field with the goal of\ncreating capable and intelligent machines. It naturally integrates aspects of\nmechanical and electrical engineering with computer science while connecting\nwith many other disciplines. Following the \u201csense-think-act\u201d paradigm, robots\nhave to (i) use a variety of sensors to continually observe and make sense of\nthe real world in real time, (ii) use appropriate algorithms to consider\ndecisions, make plans, and reason about how to influence the world,\nconsidering their own abilities, and (iii) leverage their physical embodiment\nto move in and take action on the world.\n\nThe robotics minor embraces multiple disciplines to draw strong connections\nbetween theory, computation and the physical world, both in the course\nrequirements as well as the course materials. The core robotics classes teach\nfundamental concepts and challenge students to develop strong intuition via\nhardware projects. The minor provides students not just the ability to pursue\nrobotics directly but also a perspective on how their major impacts other\nfields and how to work across disciplines throughout their careers.\n\n##  Robotics Minor Requirements\n\n  1.

Completed\napplications are due between November 15 and December 15, for enrollment at\nthe beginning of the fall term of the following year. Applicants will\nautomatically be considered for financial aid; no additional application is\nrequired.\n\nTo be admitted to graduate standing, an applicant must have received a\nbachelor\u2019s degree, or the equivalent, representing the completion of an\nundergraduate course in science or engineering related to one of the options\noffered by the Institute. Applicants must, moreover, have attained a\nscholastic record and provide recommendations to indicate the ability to\npursue, with distinction, advanced study and research. The graduate program\nthrives on individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences,\nand we highly encourage applications from members of groups underrepresented\nin science and engineering. Graduate admission is covered by [Caltech\u2019s\nNondiscrimination Policy](/current/general-information/institute-\npolicies/nondiscrimination-and-equal-employment-opportunity/).\n\nApplicants should refer to the Graduate Studies Office website for additional\nrequirements, a list of supporting documents, and option-specific application\ndeadlines.\n\nPlease note that students admitted to Caltech\u2019s PhD program will be provided\nwith financial support for tuition and living expenses to enable them to\nmaintain the singular focus and high level of productivity expected of\nstudents in the program. Most of the funding sources for this support require\nthat the student be authorized to work in the United States. Consequently,\nmatriculation into the PhD program requires evidence of work authorization,\nunless alternative financial support can be arranged with the admitting\noption.\n\n##  International Students\n\nIn order to be admitted for graduate study, students from non-English-speaking\ncountries are expected to read, write, and speak English and comprehend the\nspoken language. Although not required for admission, applicants whose native\nlanguage is not English or have not received a degree from a university or\ncollege where English is the primary language of instruction, should be able\nto demonstrate a strong capability in English prior to admission to Caltech.\nThis can be done by self-reporting scores from the Educational Testing Service\n(TOEFL), Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic), the Cambridge\nExaminations and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or\nother services that provide a certified English-language proficiency\nexamination.\n\nAll international students are evaluated upon arrival at Caltech and, if it is\ndetermined that additional instruction in English is needed, they will be\nassigned to an English as a Second Language (ESL) course. To be a candidate\nfor an advanced degree, the student must have clear self-expression in both\noral and written English.\n\n"

The invitation process\nrequires sponsorship by a Caltech faculty member, and requests should be made\ndirectly to the Graduate Studies Office, following the visiting student\ninstructions on the Graduate Studies Office website. The Dean of Graduate\nStudies may limit the number of visiting students in any given year. Visiting\nstudents are subject to the [Honor\nSystem](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/general-information/student-\nlife/#honor-system) and to all Institute policies, including the Institute\nSex- and Gender-Based Misconduct Policy. Violations of policy may affect a\nstudent's eligibility to continue enrollment.\n\nVisiting graduate students are categorized into two main classifications:\nSpecial Students and Visiting Student Researchers.\n\n###  Special Students\n\nSpecial Students are a classification of visiting students who are currently\non leave from another graduate degree program and are invited by a Caltech\nfaculty host to conduct research for a limited duration. These students are\neligible to receive academic transfer credit to be reflected on a Caltech\ntranscript and may receive a stipend. Full-time enrollment, in a graduate\nresearch course and/or coursework numbered 100 or higher, is required and\ncredits may be transferred to the home institution. Special Students, however,\nwill not be considered to be working toward a Caltech degree, and courses\ntaken under this program cannot be used to fulfill the requirements for a\nCaltech degree, nor does registration count toward the minimum residency\nrequirement for an advanced degree. Special Student appointments are granted\nfor a minimum of one term to one year, renewable each year up to a maximum of\nthree years. Special Students are required to provide proof of vaccinations in\naccordance with Institute policies, and any other required medical and\nimmunization records for the duration of the visit.\n\nSpecial Students are eligible for Caltech benefits and other student\nprivileges as defined by their enrollment status. Special Students who receive\na full Caltech stipend will also receive tuition and fees coverage, paid by\nthe faculty host. Special Students who do not receive a Caltech stipend will\nbe responsible for paying a reduced tuition and fees rate. (For current rates,\nsee the [Expense Summary](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/information-for-\ngraduate-students/graduate-expenses/#expense-summary-2022-2023).)\n\n###  Visiting Student Researchers\n\nVisiting Student Researchers (VSR's) are a classification of visiting students\nwho are not eligible to receive academic credit from Caltech but will receive\na Caltech identification card. VSR's are limited to short-term visits of one\nmonth to one year and the status is not renewable. Participants are required\nto provide proof of health insurance, vaccinations in accordance with\nInstitute policies, and any other required medical and immunization records\nfor the duration of the visit.\n\nVSR's are not eligible to receive a stipend through the Institute payroll and\nare not otherwise eligible for Caltech privileges that are normally extended\nto enrolled students. Reimbursements for research-related expenses is\npossible, but it is the Caltech faculty host\u2019s responsibility to ensure that\nthe supporting grant can be used for such purposes and that there are no\nrestrictions. Visiting students who wish to receive a stipend through the\nInstitute payroll and/or require academic credit reflected on a Caltech\ntranscript must instead be appointed as a Special Student.\n\n###  Exchange Programs\n\nSome academic options have formal exchange programs that they have arranged\nwith other institutions. Exchange students must have a visiting student\nappointment, and the type of appointment will depend upon the terms of the\nagreement for the particular exchange program. These programs are administered\nby the option, and requests should be made directly to the Graduate Studies\nOffice following the same procedure for visiting students.\n\n"

Graduate\nstudents with a Bursar\u2019s bill balance of $1,500 or more may have a hold placed\non their registration for the subsequent term the day before online\nregistration opens. The hold will be released once students have paid their\nbill or worked out a satisfactory payment plan with the Bursar\u2019s Office.\n\nBefore registering, students should consult with their adviser. An adviser is\nassigned to each entering graduate student by the option representative. In\nmost options, a new adviser is assigned when the student begins research. Only\nmembers of the professorial faculty may serve as advisers. With the approval\nof the Dean of Graduate Studies, any graduate student whose work is not\nsatisfactory may be refused registration at the beginning of any term by the\ndivision in which the student is doing their major work. See the section on\nSatisfactory Academic Progress for more information.\n\nIn registering for research, students should indicate the name of the\ninstructor in charge and should consult with the instructor to determine the\nnumber of units to which the proposed work corresponds. At the end of the\nterm, the instructor in charge may decrease the number of units for which\ncredit is given if the instructor feels that the progress of the research does\nnot justify the original amount.\n\nStudents will not receive credit for courses unless they are properly\nregistered. Students themselves are responsible for making certain that all\ngrades to which they are entitled have been properly recorded. Please note\nthat graduate students who enroll in courses numbered below 100 will not\nreceive credit for those courses unless the course(s) is specified in the\nrequirements for a graduate degree as stipulated in the _Caltech Catalog_.\n\nAll changes in registration must be reported to the Registrar\u2019s Office by the\nstudent. Such changes are governed by the last dates for adding or dropping\ncourses as shown on the [Academic Calendar](/current/academic-calendar/). A\nstudent may not withdraw from or add a course after the last date for dropping\nor adding courses without the option\u2019s consent, written approval from the\ninstructor of the relevant course, and the approval of the Dean of Graduate\nStudies.\n\nIf the withdrawal occurs after Add Day of any term, a W (standing for\n\u201cwithdrawn\u201d) will be recorded on the student\u2019s transcript for all courses in\nwhich the student is enrolled. A grade of W is not included in the computation\nof the student\u2019s grade-point average.\n\n##  General Administrative Requirements\n\nGraduate students are required to have continuity in registration, maintain\nfull-time status, make satisfactory progress, and be academically enrolled\nuntil all requirements for a degree are fulfilled. This means that students\nmust either be registered, enrolled or on an approved leave from the\nInstitute. Students who fail to do so can be withdrawn from the Institute.\nReduced duty status maintains registration for a student who cannot carry a\nfull load due to a medical condition, disability or pregnancy.\n\nRegistration is required for the term in which the thesis defense is\nundertaken, with the exception of the first week of each term. Approval of the\nDean is required for any student seeking to enroll for a subsequent term\nbeyond the defense during the academic year. Once the degree is conferred,\nfurther enrollment as a graduate student is not permitted.\n\nDetached duty status maintains registration for a student doing research at an\nexternal location, such as a national laboratory or another academic\ninstitution, for an extended period.\n\nStudents are entitled to at least two weeks\u2019 annual vacation (in addition to\nInstitute holidays), and they should arrange their vacation schedules with\ntheir research advisers early in each academic year. Any questions should be\nreferred to the Graduate Studies Office.\n\nIf a student fails to register by Add Day, they will be placed in\n\"Separated/Inactive\" status and will be ineligible to be receive a stipend or\nuse Institute facilities. Key cards will be inactivated and a hold may be\nplaced on their paycheck.\n\nTo avoid being placed in \"Separated/Inactive\" status, the student must\npetition the Dean through the Graduate Studies Office and resolve their status\nprior to being reinstated or placed on an approved leave.\n\n"

Leaves may be extended only with the agreement of the Advisor, Option\nRepresentative, and the permission of the Dean of Graduate Studies.\n\nPrior to going on leave, students must discuss with their Option and Caltech\nfaculty advisor the conditions of return. Return from leave is conditional\nupon the Option's and advisor's willingness to accept the student for\ncontinuing study, and the availability of funding. When returning from leave,\nstudents must provide at least six (6) weeks of notice to the Graduate Studies\nOffice and contact the Assistant or Associate Graduate Dean to determine\nwhether a meeting is required to discuss resuming a full-time program.\n\nA graduate student who does not return from leave as planned or does not file\nan extension request will be withdrawn from the Institute.\n\n####  While on Leave\n\nCaltech considers students on an approved leave to be matriculated; however,\nstudents on leave are not currently enrolled and therefore do not enjoy all\nrights and privileges of enrolled students. Separated students (i.e.\nunenrolled students), and accordingly, students on leave, have limited access\nto Caltech's educational activities, programs, and services. Students on leave\ndo not have access to online services including but not limited to REGIS and\nCanvas. They may not attend classes or labs, live in Institute housing*, or\naccess certain student resources, including Student Wellness Services, CASS,\nand Residential Life activities, programs, and services during their leave.\nCareer Advising and Experiential Learning (CAEL) is, by default, open to all\nstudents who have not been permanently separated from the Institute,\nregardless of leave or enrollment status, unless otherwise revoked by the\nDirector of CAEL or the dean. For questions regarding the full scope of these\nlimitations, please contact the [Graduate Studies Office](/cdn-cgi/l/email-\nprotection#80e7f2e1e4efe6e3c0e3e1ecf4e5e3e8aee5e4f5). [*Students on an\napproved pregnancy leave or bonding leave are eligible to retain Caltech\nhousing privileges.]\n\nStudents may consult with their advisor and otherwise plan for their academic\nfuture; however, they will not receive credit for courses unless they are\nproperly enrolled. Students who are on leave are still subject to all\nInstitute policies, including the Institute Sex- and Gender-Based Misconduct\nPolicy. Violations of policy may affect a student's eligibility to re-enroll.\n\n###  Personal Leave\n\nStudents who wish to take a personal (non-medical) leave must\n[petition](https://gradoffice.caltech.edu/documents/18689/petition_personal_leave.pdf)\nthrough the Graduate Studies Office. While on a personal leave, students are\nnot eligible for subsidized Caltech healthcare benefits, stipends, or other\nstudent benefits. Please refer to the\n[conditions](https://gradoffice.caltech.edu/documents/18629/non-\nmedical_leave_instructions_rev3-2021.pdf) for students on Personal Leave from\nthe Institute. Return from leave is subject to the support of a Caltech\nprofessorial faculty advisor and availability of funding.\n\nA student may request a voluntary leave of absence for personal reasons by\nsubmitting a personal (non- medical) leave petition to the Graduate Office for\napproval. International students should consult with the International Student\nPrograms (ISP) office regarding visa implications prior to submitting the\nleave petition.\n\nThe dean may grant a personal leave provided (a) the student is making\nsatisfactory academic progress as determined by the student\u2019s adviser, (b) the\nleave is for one year or less, although special circumstances can be\nconsidered for a longer leave, and (c) the leave extends over a period that\nincludes at least one full term.\n\nA petition to return from a personal leave should be submitted six (6) weeks\nbefore the first day of the term for which the student intends to return.\nReturn from a personal leave is subject to the approval of the dean and is\nsubject to the student having an approved adviser and ongoing funding to\nsupport the student\u2019s research. If a student does not anticipate having an\nadviser upon return, they will need to work with the option representative to\narrange for funding and a new adviser in advance of the return. Return will\nonly be granted once an adviser and funding are in place.\n\n###  Medical Leave\n\nIf a student is unable to complete their coursework or other course of study\ndue to medical reasons, the student may petition for a medical leave of\nabsence by submitting a medical leave petition, endorsed by the director of\nStudent Wellness Services or their designee, to the Graduate Office for\napproval. International students should consult with the International Student\nPrograms office regarding visa implications prior to submitting the medical\nleave petition.\n\nMedical leaves are expected to extend over a period that includes at least one\nfull term, although special circumstances may be considered for approval of a\nshorter leave upon the recommendation of a student\u2019s treatment team.\n\nStudents may be required to sign a release of information form authorizing\ntheir treatment provider to communicate relevant medical information to\nrepresentatives within Health and Counseling Services and the Dean\u2019s Office to\nfacilitate evaluation of the need for the leave and to determine appropriate\nconditions associated with the leave and establishing expectations for return\nfrom the leave.\n\nThe Institute may impose conditions on return from a medical leave, which may\ninclude confirmation from the student\u2019s health care provider that the student\nis following the recommended course of treatment, the student\u2019s consent for\nthe provider to discuss the student\u2019s condition or progress during the leave\nwith Caltech officials, including representatives of Health and Counseling\nServices and the Dean\u2019s Office, and an independent evaluation of the student\u2019s\nreadiness to return by a qualified medical professional. Certain conditions of\nreturn will be specified at the time of the leave approval.\n\n####  While on Leave\n\nIt is the expectation that a student on medical leave will focus on receiving\ntreatment to manage the condition(s) that precipitated the leave.\n\nStudents who have the Caltech-sponsored student health insurance plan will\nhave the opportunity to continue purchasing this insurance while on medical\nleave.\n\nStudents on medical leave will not be able to access Student Wellness Services\nduring their leave; however, they will be able to use the free TimelyCare\nservice (timelycare.com/Caltech) during their leave as long as they have an\nactive access.caltech account.\n\nA student returning from a leave for medical reasons will maintain the same\nacademic standing that they had previously \u2013 i.e., if on academic probation,\nthe student will remain on probation upon return from leave.\n\nThe duration of a medical leave should be determined primarily by the\nstudent's improvement in treatment. In general, however, medical leaves are\nexpected to include at least one full term.\n\n####  Returning from Leave\n\nThe Institute may impose conditions on return from a medical leave, which may\ninclude confirmation from the student\u2019s health care provider that the student\nis following the recommended course of treatment, the student\u2019s consent for\nthe provider to discuss the student\u2019s condition or progress during the leave\nwith Caltech officials, including representatives of Student Wellness Services\nand the Graduate Office, and an independent evaluation of the student\u2019s\nreadiness to return by a qualified medical professional. Any conditions of\nreturn will be specified at the time of the leave approval.\n\nA petition to return from medical leave must be submitted six (6) weeks before\nthe anticipated term for which the student intends to return. The return\nprocess includes an interview with the director of Student Wellness Services\nor their designee and the submission of a completed return from medical leave\npetition and provider recommendation. Students are expected to sign a release\nof information form authorizing their treatment providers to communicate with\nCaltech, including representatives of Student Wellness Services and the\nGraduate Office to determine readiness to return and any recommendations for\nreasonable accommodations. Return from a medical leave of absence is subject\nto the final approval of the dean. If the student is permitted to return from\nthe leave, any conditions of return will be communicated to the student in\nwriting.\n\nIt is the expectation that a student on medical leave will focus on receiving\ntreatment to manage the condition(s) that precipitated the leave.\n\nA student returning from a leave for medical reasons will maintain the same\nacademic standing that they had prior to the leave and will be subject to the\nsame academic requirements for maintaining academic progress. Additional\ninformation and resources regarding medical leave, including financial and\ntranscript implications, can be found at\n[gradoffice.caltech.edu/admissions/policies/LeavePolicy.](https://gradoffice.caltech.edu/admissions/policies/LeavePolicy)\n\n###  Pregnancy and Bonding Leave\n\n####  Pregnancy\n\nStudents who are unable to complete their coursework or other course of study\nfor a period of time due to a pregnancy, childbirth and related medical\nconditions are eligible for a pregnancy leave of absence. Students who are\npregnant or who have recently given birth are also eligible for reasonable\naccommodations.\n\nStudents are not required to take a leave of absence, withdraw, or limit their\ngraduate studies because of pregnancy, childbirth or related medical\nconditions. However, students who are disabled due to pregnancy, childbirth\nand related medical conditions are eligible to take a pregnancy leave of\nabsence. The Institute provides up to 6 weeks of pay to students during a\npregnancy leave of absence; an additional 8 weeks of pay are available through\nfamily bonding leave (see following section).\n\nA pregnant student who wishes to take a pregnancy leave should submit a\n[pregnancy leave\npetition](https://gradoffice.caltech.edu/documents/8681/Petition_pregnancy_and_bonding_leave.pdf)\nto the Graduate Office. Medical documentation from the student's treating\nhealth care provider may be required.\n\nA student who chooses to take a leave of absence because they are pregnant or\nhave recently given birth shall be allowed an additional period commensurate\nwith the length of the leave, but not to exceed 12 additional months, to\nprepare for and take preliminary and qualifying examinations and an equal\nextension of time toward the normative time to degree while in candidacy for a\ngraduate degree, unless a longer extension is medically necessary.\n\nAn enrolled student in good standing who chooses to take a leave of absence\nbecause they are pregnant or have recently given birth shall return to their\nprogram in good academic standing following an approved leave period up to one\nacademic year, subject to the administrative requirements described above,\nunless there is a medical reason for a longer leave, in which case standing in\nthe graduate program shall be maintained during that period of the leave.\n\nThe Institute also provides reasonable accommodations to pregnant students\nconsistent with federal and state law. Reasonable accommodations may include\nallowing pregnant students to maintain a safe distance from hazardous\nsubstances, allowing them to make up tests and assignments that are missed for\npregnancy-related reasons or excusing of absences that are medically\nnecessary. If in Caltech housing, students may remain while on pregnancy\nleave.\n\n####  Bonding\n\nGraduate students may take up to 8 weeks of family bonding leave with pay. An\nenrolled student in good academic standing who chooses to take a leave of\nabsence because of the recent birth or adoption of his or her child may\nrequest a bonding leave by submitting a [bonding leave\npetition](https://gradoffice.caltech.edu/documents/8681/Petition_pregnancy_and_bonding_leave.pdf)\nto the Graduate Office for approval. Bonding leave is in addition to pregnancy\nleave, providing eligible students with a combined total of up to 14 weeks of\npaid leave. Students returning from an approved bonding leave shall return to\nhis or her program in good academic standing following the leave, subject to\nthe administrative requirements described above. If in Caltech housing,\nstudents may remain while on bonding leave.\n\n###  Involuntary Leave\n\nThe Dean or designee may determine that it is necessary to place a student on\nan involuntary leave in a variety of circumstances, including when a student\ndemonstrates behavior that poses a threat to health or safety, causes\nsignificant disruption to the Caltech community, for the personal safety or\nwelfare of the student involved, as an interim measure, or as a result of a\ndisciplinary action.\n\nThe Dean may impose an involuntary leave in appropriate circumstances, such as\nwhere a student\u2019s behavior: (1) has, or threatens to, cause significant\nproperty damage; (2) significantly disrupts the Caltech community; (3)\npresents a substantial risk of harm to self or others; (4) indicates the\nstudent is unable or unwilling to carry out self-care obligations; or (5)\nviolates a Caltech policy or the honor system.\n\nAn involuntary leave also may be imposed when the student requires a level of\ncare from the Institute community that exceeds the reasonable accommodations,\nresources and staffing that the Institute can reasonably be expected to\nprovide for the student\u2019s well-being.\n\n####  Review and Decision Process\n\nIf the conduct has been the subject of an investigation or review under an\nInstitute process or procedure, the Dean will consider the findings and\nconclusions reached in that process. In other circumstances described above,\nin making an informed decision to place a student on involuntary leave, the\nDean will conduct an individualized assessment and consider relevant\ninformation including information provided in a timely manner by the student.\nThe Dean may consult with other Institute personnel, including but not limited\nto Security and Residential Life personnel, faculty, staff and other\nindividuals or departments. If appropriate and feasible, the Dean may seek\ncooperation and involvement of parents or guardians of the student. Medical\ninformation, including medical information provided in a timely manner by the\nstudent, may be considered if the behavior is associated with a physical or\nmental condition. In appropriate cases, the Dean may consult with the\nexecutive director of Student Wellness Services and/or require a physical or\nmental evaluation from a health professional if the Dean believes such an\nevaluation is necessary in order to make an informed decision. Students are\nexpected, if necessary, to sign a release of information to facilitate\ndiscussions between Caltech and the health professional conducting the\nevaluation. The Dean will also consider whether relevant risk factors can be\neliminated or reduced to an acceptable level through reasonable accommodation.\n\n####  Written Decision\n\nThe student will be advised in writing of the decision to impose an\ninvoluntary leave. The Dean may stipulate conditions that must be met before\nthe student may return. An involuntary leave may be a permanent separation\nfrom the Institute (i.e. expulsion); for a specific duration; or until certain\nconditions have been met. If the involuntary leave is not a permanent\nseparation, the student will be advised of the length of the leave and/or any\nconditions for return.\n\n####  Disciplinary Notations on Transcripts\n\nIf a student is ineligible to reenroll at Caltech due to the imposition of an\ninvoluntary leave, the Institute shall include on the student\u2019s transcript a\nnotation stating that the student is ineligible to reenroll at Caltech because\nthey have been subject to a disciplinary suspension or expulsion. A notation\nof expulsion is permanent, and a notation of suspension will remain on the\nstudent\u2019s record for seven years.\n\nOn request by the student, Caltech may remove from a student\u2019s transcript a\nnotation of suspension if:\n\n(1) the student becomes eligible to reenroll at Caltech; **or**\n\n(2) the Institute determines that good cause exists to remove the notation.\n\n###  Emergency Leave\n\nIf the Dean determines that a student's continued presence is likely to pose a\nsubstantial risk to the safety and well-being of the student or others, the\nDean may place the student on an emergency interim leave before a final\ndetermination is made. The Dean will make reasonable attempts to meet with the\nstudent and consider relevant information, including in appropriate cases\nmedical information provided by the student, before deciding on an emergency\ninterim leave. An emergency interim leave will remain in effect until a final\ndecision has been made.\n\n####  Return from Leave\n\nA student on involuntary leave will not be allowed to return until the Dean\nmakes a fact-specific assessment of the circumstances, considers relevant risk\nfactors, and concludes that the student does not pose a significant disruption\nto the functioning of the Institute community and/or does not pose a\nsubstantial risk to the health and safety of the student or others. The Dean\nwill consider relevant information, including information provided by the\nstudent. In cases where a student has a physical or mental condition\nassociated with the behavior triggering the leave, the Dean will also consider\nwhether the relevant risks can be eliminated by a reasonable accommodation.\nThe student will be notified in writing if the Dean determines that the\nstudent will not be permitted to return from a leave or will be permanently\nseparated from the Institute.\n\n####  Appeal\n\nA decision by the Dean to place a student on involuntary leave may be appealed\nin writing within ten days to the Vice President for Student Affairs (or\ndesignee). If the leave is imposed as a sanction resulting from a finding of\nresponsibility under an Institute process, any applicable limitations on\ngrounds for appeal will apply.\n\n"

        "content": "The relationship between a faculty adviser and graduate student should be\nfounded on mutual respect and open communication. Advisers and students should\ndiscuss the nature of their working relationship early and continue this\ndiscussion throughout their period of collaboration to ensure mutually\nunderstood and compatible expectations. These discussions should be frequent\nand open, and should include not only work, research goals, and performance\nreviews, but also change of status, time for personal and family\nresponsibilities, time off, and concerns about academic or work situations.\nBoth the student and adviser have the obligation to initiate meetings as\nnecessary to ensure the success of the relationship.\n\nAfter achieving candidacy, each Ph.D. student should be assigned a thesis\nadvising committee consisting of a minimum of three professorial faculty\nmembers. This committee typically meets at least once a year beginning after\ncandidacy or the fourth year of graduate study.\n\nThe graduate student-faculty adviser relationship should be guided by norms of\nfairness and professionalism. Both faculty and graduate students should avoid\nrelationships that conflict with their respective roles and duties at Caltech.\nBoth are bound by the prevailing policies prohibiting discrimination and\nharassment ([Nondiscrimination Policy](/current/general-information/institute-\npolicies/nondiscrimination-and-equal-employment-opportunity/), [Sex- and\nGender-Based Misconduct](/current/general-information/institute-policies/sex-\nand-gender-based-misconduct/), and [Unlawful Harassment](/current/general-\ninformation/institute-policies/unlawful-harassment/)). Concerns relating to\nacademic or work situations should be raised promptly between the persons\ndirectly involved, and handled informally if possible. Both students and\nadvisers have the responsibility to raise and address concerns and conflicts\npromptly, honestly, and in a manner that conforms with academic integrity and\nprofessionalism. Caltech policy requires that students\u2019 concerns be addressed\nfairly and promptly, and prohibits retaliation or discrimination against\nstudents for appropriately voicing or raising a concern.\n\nIf a problem remains unresolved or if direct discussion is not possible, a\nstudent can seek assistance from division officers (e.g., option\nrepresentatives) or the graduate deans. At any time, a student may request\nthat discussions remain confidential.

This is one of the unique aspects of Caltech\u2019s graduate school and a\nkey factor in the high level of productivity and accomplishment by our\ngraduate students. To enable this, the faculty and Institute provide financial\naid in the form of fellowships, tuition scholarships, graduate teaching, and\nresearch assistantships. The stipend and salary levels for students are modest\nbut sufficient for economical students to live debt-free during their graduate\nstudies. The financial support provided by the Institute and the requirements\nfor continuous enrollment also enable almost all students to complete the\ndegree programs in a timely manner.\n\nIn turn, the Institute expects that graduate students should be 100 percent\ncommitted to graduate studies while enrolled in a graduate program. Graduate\nstudents are expected to be continuously enrolled full-time, year-round, until\nthey complete their degree program. In addition, graduate students should not\naccept employment, start or run a business, or engage in any activity inside\nor outside of the Institute that creates a conflict of commitment with their\nfull-time, degree-seeking status.\n\n##  Exceptions\n\nThere are some very limited exceptions to this policy. The Institute\nencourages extracurricular activities that provide service to the community\nand do not impact the student\u2019s academic progress or full-time status. The\nInstitute also recognizes that some students desire to gain experience as\ninstructors or work in an educational or research setting outside of Caltech.\n\n##  Outside Employment\n\nStudents must have the approval of their adviser, the option representative,\nand the dean of graduate studies in order to engage in any outside employment\nactivities. Approval is contingent on demonstrating that outside work does not\ncompromise the full-time commitment to graduate studies. Once permission is\ngranted, students may engage in employment of up to one day per week (8 hours)\nfor a limited-duration for these purposes (see [Financial\nAssistance](/current/information-for-graduate-students/financial-\nassistance/)).\n\nStudents must declare to the dean of graduate studies all external funding,\nincluding fellowships, awards, or employment, part- or full-time. The\nInstitute may adjust Institute financial aid accordingly to maintain the\nstipend within the Institute guidelines and to recover tuition from outside\nsources whenever possible. A student\u2019s financial aid and/or Institute salary\nmay be reduced if the income is significant. In the case of long-term,\nunreported employment activities, the student may be asked to repay financial\naid. Students may not hold a position of line responsibility in an outside\nenterprise for pay or profit.\n\nInternational students on a visa are further required to consult with the\noffice of International Student Programs to determine eligibility. Students\nmust provide official documentation of the financial award or salary, as well\nas submit a request to the Graduate Office before accepting any employment.\nPermission to engage in outside employment is contingent on the student\nmaintaining satisfactory academic progress as determined by the dean of\ngraduate studies in consultation with the adviser and option representative.\n\n##  Non-Paid Activities\n\nStudents must have the approval of their adviser, the option representative,\nand the dean of graduate studies in order to engage in or continue in any\noutside activities wherein the time committed to those activities may impact\nthe student\u2019s progress toward completion of degree requirements.\n\n##  Leave of Absence\n\nStudents who work full-time off campus in a commercial organization are\nexpected to take a personal leave of absence. They will not be enrolled during\nthis time, and the \u201cclock\u201d will stop on their graduate career. Taking a\npersonal leave in order to work requires the endorsement of the adviser and\npermission of the dean of graduate studies. A personal leave is always\nrequired when the job is not directly related to thesis research. Students who\nneed to stop their studies to address health issues should take a medical\nleave of absence, which requires the endorsement of Student Wellness Services\nas well as the permission of the dean of graduate studies.\n\n##  Detached Duty\n\nIn some cases, a student may be engaged in research at an external laboratory\nor research institute under the supervision of a Caltech faculty adviser, and\nconducting research that is directly related to their degree program. Another\nsituation is that a student may be invited to be a visiting researcher at\nanother university, or the student may need to be working with a faculty\nmember who has left Caltech and is working at another institution.\n\nStudents may go on detached duty rather than on leave of absence if the\nadviser and dean of graduate studies approve and there is documentation of a\nresearch program integral to their thesis project and appropriate mentoring.\nStudents on detached duty should have completed their residency requirements\nand advanced to candidacy prior to moving to the host institution.\n\nThe student should submit the documentation and a petition form to the\nGraduate Office. Students on detached duty are still enrolled as full-time\nstudents but are in residence at another location. They may be paid by Caltech\nor through another organization. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to\ncontinue to be in good standing, and registered and in full-time status while\non detached duty. Detached duty petitions are usually valid for a limited\ntime, less than one year, and may be renewed upon request.\n\n##  Consulting and Other Entrepreneurial Activities\n\nGraduate students are sometimes approached to perform paid consulting or are\ninspired to be entrepreneurs. In these cases, students have to be\nexceptionally careful not to create conflicts of commitment or conflicts of\ninterest through these activities. Students considering these activities\nshould familiarize themselves with the Caltech policies on conflict of\ninterest, outside employment or business activity, and the Caltech ethics\nhandbook. Students may not engage in any consulting activities that interfere\nwith their primary graduate student activities of learning and research.\nScrupulous care must be taken to ensure that Caltech\u2019s name and its letterhead\nare used neither directly in any correspondence between the student and the\ncompany the student wishes to consult for, nor in any reports that student may\nsubmit to the company.\n\nOf particular concern are students consulting or accepting employment from a\ncompany in which their adviser or other Caltech faculty member is directing a\nstudent\u2019s research and has a significant interest or is a paid consultant. In\nsuch cases, the division chair must approve any student involvement in the\nactivities performed for the company. The student must submit a written\ndisclosure, and a conflict management plan will be put in place.\n\nGraduate students should not enter into any consulting or employment agreement\nwith intellectual property encumbrances or confidentiality provisions that are\nin conflict with the student\u2019s commitments to Caltech or that may compromise\nacademic progress.\n\nPlease refer to the Graduate Office website for the complete policy and\nregulations regarding conflicts of commitment and interest. If there are any\nquestions about the propriety of any outside activity or agreements, this\nshould be discussed with the Graduate Office and, if necessary, the Office of\nResearch Compliance and the Office of the General Counsel.\n\n"

The special laboratory should recognize its\ncommitment of special equipment or any other resources required for the thesis\nwork. Approval by the special laboratory should also indicate that the thesis\ntopic is a sensible one, and that it is not likely to be preempted by the\nlaboratory.\n\nA student may take similar advantage of unique opportunities at a corporate or\ngovernmental research and development facility under the same conditions,\nproviding that there exists a formal written agreement between the R&D\nfacility and the student\u2019s thesis adviser, and that advance written approval\nis obtained from the dean of graduate studies. Such training may in some cases\ninvolve full-time employment at the laboratory for a limited period of time\nfor the purpose of engaging in the essential data collection that is integral\nto a student\u2019s thesis. Typically, such students who are not in a local\nlaboratory are placed on detached duty status.\n\nEmployment by a special laboratory of a graduate student for work not\nconnected with the thesis should be regarded as equivalent to other outside\nemployment.\n\n"

        "source": "Caltech Course Catalog / 2024-2025 Catalog / Information for Graduate Students / General Requirements for Graduate Degrees",
        "content": "##  Degree of Master of Science\n\nThe Master of Science degree is a professional degree designed to prepare a\nstudent for teaching, for further graduate studies, or for more advanced work\nin industry. Detailed requirements are based primarily on professional\nstudies, and the program should be planned in consultation with the faculty in\nthe appropriate discipline. Under normal circumstances, the requirements for\nthe master's degree can be completed in one academic year. Students must\ndeclare candidacy for the master's degree no later than the academic year in\nwhich the final degree requirements have been met or upon separation from the\nInstitute. Students who are pursuing a doctoral degree and obtain a master\u2019s\nalong the way, must declare candidacy for the master\u2019s no later than two weeks\nprior to conferral of the Ph.D.\n\nA student who enters the Institute holding a master's degree from another\ninstitution will not normally be awarded a second master's degree in the same\nfield. A student will not be awarded two master's degrees from the Institute.\n\nSpecial regulations for the master's degree are listed under each graduate\noption. Several options do not offer a master's degree except in special\ncircumstances.\n\n###  Residence and Units of Graduate Work Required\n\nAt least one academic year of enrollment at the Institute and a minimum of 135\nunits of graduate work at the Institute subsequent to the baccalaureate degree\nare required for the master's degree. Included in these units are at least 27\nunits of free electives or of required studies in the humanities numbered 100\nor above. Advanced courses taken while enrolled as a Caltech undergraduate\nstudent in excess of the bachelor\u2019s degree requirements may be counted toward\nthe master's degree requirements with the approval of the academic Option\nRepresentative and the Dean of Graduate Studies.\n\nTo qualify for a master's degree, a student must complete the work indicated\nin the section on special regulations for their option with a grade-point\naverage for the approved master\u2019s candidacy courses of at least 1.9.\n\nIn special cases, with the approval of the instructor, option representative,\nand the Dean of Graduate Studies, courses taken elsewhere before enrollment at\nthe Institute may be offered in place of specifically required courses. An\nexamination may be required to determine the acceptability of such courses.\nCourse credit, if granted, shall not count toward the 135-unit and residency\nrequirements.\n\n###  Admission to M.S. Candidacy\n\nBy the third term of the academic year in which the student expects to receive\nthe degree, candidates should have completed a plan of study in Regis, which\nmust have the approval of the option representative and, in some cases, of the\nresearch adviser. This approved plan of study will constitute requirements for\nthe degree. Any modifications to the plan of study must be approved by the\nOption Representative no later than two weeks before the degree is to be\nconferred. Some options require a thesis or research report in addition to\ncourse requirements. The thesis or research report must be approved by the\nresearch adviser and option representative no later than two weeks before the\ndegree is to be conferred. For additional information and option-specific\nrequirements, please refer to the section \u201cSpecial Regulations for Graduate\nOptions.\u201d\n\n###  Joint B.S./M.S. Degree\n\nIn exceptional cases, undergraduate students may be eligible to pursue a joint\nB.S./M.S. program of study to be completed within the four years (12 terms) of\nthe undergraduate program. The M.S. degree may be in a different field than\nthe B.S. option. Students should contact the respective graduate Option\nRepresentative to find out if the joint B.S./M.S. degree is offered in a\nparticular option by the start of junior year. If so, students must follow the\nnormal procedures for admission to the graduate program. Students admitted to\nthe joint B.S./M.S. degree must complete a minimum of 486 units for the\nbachelor's program and an additional 135 units for the master's program with\nno overlapping of courses. In addition, a written plan of study must be\nsubmitted to the Registrar\u2019s Office for approval no later than the fall term\nof the senior year. The plan of study should provide detail of the courses\nthat are proposed to satisfy each degree requirement within the 12 terms of\nthe bachelor's program and once approved shall constitute the requirements for\nthe degree. Additional terms and overloads are not permitted. Any changes to\nthe plan require written approval by the Registrar. If not completed within\nthe four years, students will be removed from the joint program and they, and\nall their courses, will be attached to the bachelor's program. Students\nenrolled in the joint B.S./M.S. degree will be considered undergraduate\nstudents and will not be eligible for graduate financial aid, graduate\nhousing, or other graduate student privileges.\n\n##  Engineer\u2019s Degree\n\nEngineer\u2019s degrees are awarded in exceptional circumstances. The work for an\nengineer\u2019s degree must consist of advanced studies and research in the field\nappropriate to the degree desired. It must conform to the special requirements\nestablished for that degree and should be planned in consultation with the\nmembers of the faculty concerned. Students who have been admitted to the\nterminal master's degree and wish to pursue further studies leading toward\neither the engineer\u2019s or the Ph.D. degree must file a petition (and in some\ncases must file a new application) to continue graduate work toward the\ndesired degree. Students who have received an engineer\u2019s degree will not be\nadmitted for the Ph.D.\n\n###  Residence\n\nAt least eight terms of graduate academic enrollment subsequent to a\nbachelor\u2019s degree equivalent to that given by the Institute are required for\nan engineer\u2019s degree. Of these, at least three terms must be at Caltech. It\nmust be understood that these are minimum requirements, and students must\noften count on spending a somewhat longer time on graduate work.\n\nTo qualify for an engineer\u2019s degree, a student must complete the work\nprescribed by the supervising committee with a grade-point average of at least\n1.9. Research work and the preparation of a thesis must constitute no fewer\nthan 55 units. More than 55 units may be required by certain options, and the\nstudent should determine the particular requirements of their option when\nestablishing a program.\n\n###  Admission to Candidacy\n\nBefore the midpoint of the first term of the academic year in which the\nstudent expects to receive the degree, they must complete a proposed plan of\nstudy and, in consultation with the chair of the appropriate division, will\nselect a committee comprised of at least three members of the professorial\nfaculty to supervise the student\u2019s work and to certify its satisfactory\ncompletion. The student should consult with this committee in planning the\ndetails of their work. The plan of study shall then constitute the\nrequirements for the degree. Any modifications must be approved by the Option\nRepresentative at least two weeks before the degree is conferred.\n\nThe student will be admitted to candidacy for the degree when the supervising\ncommittee certifies (a) that all the special requirements for the desired\ndegree have been met, with the exception that certain courses of not more than\ntwo terms in length may be taken after admission to candidacy; (b) that the\nthesis research has been satisfactorily started and can be finished at the\nexpected date; (c) that the candidate demonstrates competence in oral and\nwritten English.\n\nAdmission to candidacy should be obtained by the midpoint of the term in which\nthe degree is to be granted, but no later than the academic year in which the\nfinal degree requirements have been met or upon separation from the Institute.\n\n###  Thesis\n\nEngineer's degree candidates are required to upload a final thesis by June 1\nin the year the degree is to be conferred in accordance with the same\nregulations that govern the preparation of doctoral dissertations. These\nregulations may be obtained from the Graduate Office website.\n\nThe use of \u201cclassified\u2019\u2019 research as thesis material for any degree will not\nbe permitted. Exceptions to this rule can be made only under special\ncircumstances, and then only when approval is given by the Dean of Graduate\nStudies before the research is undertaken.\n\n###  Examination\n\nAt the discretion of the option in which the degree is desired, a final\nexamination may be required. This examination would be conducted by a\ncommittee appointed by the candidate\u2019s supervising committee.\n\n##  Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\nThe degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) is conferred by the Institute\nprimarily in recognition of breadth of scholarship, depth of research, and the\npower to investigate problems independently and efficiently, rather than for\nthe completion of definite courses of study through a stated period of\nresidence. The work for the degree must consist of research and the\npreparation of a thesis describing it, and of systematic studies of an\nadvanced character, primarily in science or engineering. In addition, the\ncandidate must have clear self-expression in both oral and written English.\n\nSubject to the general supervision of the Committee on Graduate Study, the\nstudent\u2019s work for the Ph.D. degree is specifically directed by the division\nin which they have chosen the major subject. Each student should consult with\ntheir division concerning special divisional and option requirements.\n\n###  Admission\n\nWith the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies, students are admitted to\ngraduate standing by the option in which they choose their major work toward\nthe Ph.D. degree. In some cases, applicants for the Ph.D. may be required to\ncomplete requirements for the master's degree first; however, this is not a\ngeneral prerequisite for the Ph.D. Students who have received an engineer\u2019s\ndegree will not be admitted for the Ph.D. degree.\n\nA student who holds a Ph.D. or the equivalent from another institution will\nnot normally be admitted to graduate standing at Caltech to pursue a second\nPh.D. degree. A student will not normally be awarded two Ph.D. degrees from\nthe Institute.\n\n###  Minor Programs of Study\n\nThe Institute does not require a minor for the Ph.D. degree, but the\nindividual options may have minor requirements as part of their requirements\nfor the major.\n\nA doctoral student may undertake a minor program of study in most options as\nspecified in this catalog under the section \u201cSpecial Regulations of Graduate\nOptions.\u201d Completion of a minor program of study is recognized on the diploma\nby the statement \u201c\u2026and by additional studies constituting a minor in [name of\noption].\u201d\n\nA minor program of study should be at a level of study in the minor\nsubstantially beyond that typically acquired by students as part of their\nmajor requirements. Most options require 45 units or more, including at least\none 200-level course and a coherent program of the supporting 100-level\ncourses. The faculty of the minor option may approve a proposed minor program\non the basis of overall class performance and/or by an oral examination.\n\nDetailed requirements for minor options are listed under the individual\noptions. Students cannot use courses required by their major option in\nfulfillment of the minor requirement.\n\n###  Academic Enrollment\n\nAt least three academic years (12 terms) of academic enrollment subsequent to\na bachelor's degree equivalent to that given by the Institute are required for\nthe Ph.D. Of this, at least one year (4 terms) must be at the Institute. It\nshould be understood that these are minimum requirements, and students must\nusually count on spending a somewhat longer time in work for the degree. A\nstudent whose undergraduate work has been insufficient in amount or too\nnarrowly specialized, or whose preparation in their special field is\ninadequate, should plan upon spending increased time in work for the degree.\n\nHowever, no student will be allowed to continue work toward the Ph.D. degree\nfor more than six academic years (24 terms) of graduate enrollment, without an\nextended registration petition approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies.\n\n###  Registration\n\nContinuity of registration must be maintained until all requirements for the\nPh.D. have been completed, with the exception of authorized leaves.\nRegistration is typically required for the term in which the thesis defense is\nundertaken.\n\n###  Thesis Advisers and Committee Chairs\n\nThe thesis adviser must be a full-time, tenured or tenure-track faculty\nmember. Research faculty, emeritus faculty, and Faculty Associates (in some\ngraduate options only) can supervise thesis research; however, the thesis\nadviser of record must be a tenured or tenure-track Caltech faculty member. In\nsuch cases, responsibilities of the adviser of record include general\nadvising, monitoring student progress, and meeting with the student at least\ntwice a year. Expectations for the relationship between graduate students and\nfaculty advisers are discussed under [Guidelines for Graduate Student\nAdvising](/current/information-for-graduate-students/graduate-policies-and-\nprocedures/guidelines-for-graduate-student-advising/).\n\nProgress through the graduate program is monitored in part by the candidacy,\nthesis advisory, and thesis examination committees detailed in the following\nsections. Each committee has a chair who is responsible for running the\nmeeting, summarizing the outcome, and working with the graduate student and\nadviser as appropriate. The chair of each committee is a professorial faculty\nmember distinct from the adviser.\n\n###  Admission to Candidacy\n\nOn the recommendation of the option concerned, the Dean of Graduate Studies\nwill admit a student to candidacy for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy after\nthe student has been admitted to work toward the Ph.D. and has been enrolled\nfor at least one term; has initiated a program of study approved by the major\noption and, if needed, by the minor option; has demonstrated, by written or\noral examination, a comprehensive grasp of the major and minor subjects and of\nsubjects fundamental to them; has displayed the ability for clear self-\nexpression in both oral and written English; and has shown ability in carrying\non research in a subject approved by the option concerned. Option regulations\nconcerning admission to candidacy are given in a later section.\n\nDepending upon option regulations, candidates will either be assigned a\ncandidacy committee by the Option Representative or must independently select\nappropriate members to serve on the candidacy committee. A candidacy committee\nconsists of a minimum of three members, two of whom must be professorial\nfaculty. Emeritus faculty, research faculty, JPL staff and external scholars\nmay serve on the candidacy committee, with approval of the Option\nRepresentative and the Dean of Graduate Studies in advance of the candidacy\nexamination. The student should ensure that all members of the committee are\navailable during the examination period and that they are willing to provide\ntimely and appropriate feedback.\n\nA student not admitted to candidacy by the end of the third year or twelfth\nterm of graduate enrollment at the Institute must petition the Dean of\nGraduate Studies for permission to register for further work. Approval of the\npetition for extended registration requires a plan to complete the candidacy\nexam and any outstanding coursework within two terms.\n\nCandidacy (and permission to register) may be withdrawn by formal action of\nthe option from a student whose research is not satisfactory, or for other\ncompelling reasons. However, the option must petition through its Division\nChair to the Dean of Graduate Studies before taking such action.\n\n###  Thesis Advisory Committee\n\nEach Ph.D. student is assigned a Thesis Advisory Committee consisting of a\nminimum of three professorial faculty members. Emeritus faculty, research\nfaculty, JPL staff and external scholars may serve on the thesis examination\ncommittee with approval of the option representative and the Dean of Graduate\nStudies. Following candidacy, or by the fourth year of graduate study, a\nstudent will have an annual meeting as specified by the option with either the\nthesis advisory committee, the committee chair, or the option representative\n(if not the adviser), to discuss progress towards completing the thesis and\nfuture plans.\n\n###  Thesis Examination\n\nEach Ph.D. candidate shall undergo broad oral examination on the major\nsubject, the scope of the thesis, and its significance in relation to the\nmajor subject. The thesis examination, subject to the approval of the Dean of\nGraduate Studies, may be taken after admission to candidacy whenever the\ncandidate is prepared; however, it must take place at least three weeks before\nthe degree is to be conferred.\n\nThe thesis examination may be written in part and may be subdivided into parts\nor given all at one time at the discretion of the options concerned. The\nstudent must declare their intent to defend by posting the exam details in\nRegis not less than two weeks before the date of the examination. A thesis\nexamination committee consists of four members, with a minimum of three\nprofessorial faculty. Emeritus faculty, research faculty, JPL staff and\nexternal scholars may serve on the thesis examination committee with approval\nof the Option Representative and the Dean of Graduate Studies in advance of\nthe thesis examination.\n\n###  Thesis\n\nAt least two weeks before the final oral examination, the candidate is\nrequired to provide a draft copy of the completed thesis to the Graduate\nOffice for proofreading as well as to the members of the thesis examination\ncommittee. The date of the examination and the composition of the thesis\nexamination committee should be posted in Regis at least two weeks before the\nfinal defense is scheduled. In general, registration is required for the term\nin which the thesis defense is undertaken. Approval of the Dean of Graduate\nStudies is required for any student seeking to enroll for a subsequent term\nfollowing the thesis defense. This enrollment will be limited to one term and\ncannot be granted after the degree has been conferred. A student not receiving\nCaltech funding, may petition the Dean of Graduate Studies for a tuition\nwaiver if the student schedules the examination by the third Friday of the\nterm in which the examination will be taken.\n\nBefore uploading the final, corrected thesis to CaltechTHESIS, it is the\ncandidate\u2019s responsibility to obtain approval of the thesis by the Option\nRepresentative and all members of the thesis examination committee.\n\nThe final version of the thesis must be uploaded to CaltechTHESIS by June 1 in\nthe year that the degree is to be conferred. Students who cannot meet this\ndeadline are required to petition the Dean of Graduate Studies for an\nextension to keep the thesis active. In such cases, the degree would be\nconferred in the following year\u2019s commencement. It is required that all Ph.D.\ncandidates submit an electronic copy of their dissertation, which the Caltech\nLibrary will then archive and make available online as part of the Networked\nDigital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD), an international\norganization that allows researchers to globally search a database of\nelectronic theses and dissertations. For special option regulations concerning\ntheses or the exam composition, see specific graduate options.\n\nWith the approval of the option concerned, a portion of the thesis may consist\nof one or more articles published jointly by the candidate and members of the\nInstitute staff or other coauthors. In any case, however, a substantial\nportion of the thesis must be the candidate\u2019s own exposition of their own\nwork.\n\nThe use of \u201cclassified\u2019\u2019 research as thesis material for any degree is not\npermitted. Exceptions to this rule can be made only under special\ncircumstances, and then only when approval is given by the Dean of Graduate\nStudies before the research is undertaken.\n\n[Regulations](https://gradoffice.caltech.edu/documents/28130/phd-\nthesis_guidelines_rev_04-2024.pdf) and directions for the preparation of\ntheses may be obtained from the Graduate Office website and should be followed\ncarefully by the candidate. Thesis templates are also available at\n[https://library.caltech.edu/theses,](https://library.caltech.edu/theses ) as\nis information regarding thesis deposits, embargo policies and copyright\nissues.\n\n##  Satisfactory Academic Progress\n\nTo continue in a degree program, graduate students must maintain satisfactory\nacademic progress, as defined in this section. In addition, graduate students\nmust comply with Institute policies and codes of conduct to remain in good\nstanding.\n\n###  General Guidelines\n\nGraduate students must continuously maintain a full-time program of study and\nresearch in each of the four terms during the year (including summer) until\nall degree requirements have been completed, unless a leave of absence is\ngranted. Students who do not enroll continuously or do not enroll upon\nexpiration of a leave of absence are separated from the Institute. Enrolled\nstudents are expected to be in person and approval by the Option and Dean of\nGraduate Studies is required for remote enrollment.\n\nA full-time program of study consists of enrollment in 36 units per term,\nincluding research units. Many options require a minimum grade in particular\ncourses or groups of courses. If this grade requirement is not met, a limited\nnumber of courses may be repeated and would count toward the 36-unit-per-term\nrequirement. Approval by the Dean of Graduate Studies is required before\ndropping any course that brings a student below 36 units. The treatment of\nincomplete grades and withdrawals is specified in Grades and Grading.\nSatisfactory academic progress is monitored each academic term by the Graduate\nStudies Office.\n\nThe Master of Science degree requires at least three terms in person at the\nInstitute and a minimum of 135 units of graduate work with a grade-point\naverage of at least 1.9. The master's degree is limited to two years unless a\npetition is approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies.\n\nThe degree of Engineer consists of advanced studies and research and requires\nat least eight terms of enrollment with a grade-point average of at least 1.9.\nThe engineer\u2019s degree is limited to 12 terms unless a petition is approved by\nthe Dean of Graduate Studies.\n\nThe Doctor of Philosophy degree consists of advanced studies and research,\nprimarily in science or engineering, under the guidance of an adviser, and the\npreparation and defense of a doctoral thesis. At least 12 terms of enrollment\nare required with a grade-point average of at least 1.9. The typical Ph.D. can\nbe completed in six years or less and is limited to 24 terms unless an\nextended registration petition is approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies. A\ndoctoral student who has not been admitted to candidacy within 12 terms must\npetition the Dean of Graduate Studies for extended registration. Petitions for\nextended registration for candidacy must include a plan and schedule for\ncompletion of candidacy within two terms, agreed upon and signed by the\nstudent, the student\u2019s thesis adviser, and the Option Representative. Students\nwho fail to complete candidacy within the two terms may be placed on academic\nprobation and will not be allowed to enroll without a scheduled candidacy date\nwith their advisory committee.\n\n###  Advising and Communication\n\nAll doctoral students must have a thesis adviser to remain in good academic\nstanding. The timeline for securing a thesis adviser varies by the specific\ngraduate option (see Special Regulations for Graduate Options). A student\u2019s\nthesis adviser must be an active member of the Caltech professorial faculty\nand is responsible for general advising, approving and guiding a research\ntopic, monitoring the student\u2019s progress until all degree requirements have\nbeen met, and in most cases, providing financial support for the duration of\nthe degree program.\n\nStudents are expected to communicate and interact with their adviser on a\nregular and timely basis regarding academic progress. Students are also\nexpected to respond in a timely manner to official communications from the\nGraduate Studies Office or their academic Option (i.e., the Dean, Associate\nDean, Assistant Dean, Option Representatives, Option Managers, other graduate\nprogram administrators, committee members, and other faculty members). Failure\nto do so may result in referral to the Dean of Graduate Studies for possible\ncorrective action.\n\n###  Determination of Satisfactory Academic Progress\n\nSatisfactory academic progress is judged by the Options against the guidelines\nset in Special Regulations for Graduate Options in the Institute Catalog for\nthe year of initial enrollment. These guidelines typically detail the\nfollowing requirements, along with a timeline: completion of specific courses,\noral and/or written examinations, advancement to candidacy, securing of a\nthesis adviser, and research requirements. For students failing to meet Option\nguidelines, revocation of permission to enroll may be recommended by the\nOption to the Dean of Graduate Studies. Further, even after advancement to\ncandidacy, permission to enroll may be denied by formal action of an Option\ndue to unsatisfactory research performance, failure to secure or maintain a\nthesis adviser, or other compelling reasons. However, the Option must petition\nthrough its Division Chair to the Dean of Graduate Studies before taking such\naction.\n\nFailure to achieve the expectations above may result in academic probation or\ndisciplinary action, including separation from the Institute. A decision to\nrevoke permission to enroll may be appealed in writing within ten days to the\nVice President and Faculty Dean of Students or designee.\n\n###  Good Standing\n\nA student is in good standing if they meet standards for Satisfactory Academic\nProgress and program and research requirements and are not currently on any\nprobationary status.\n\n###  Academic Probation\n\nThe graduate deans, in consultation with a student\u2019s academic adviser and/or\ndivision, can place a student on academic probation for failure to meet the\nwritten expectations for Satisfactory Academic Progress. A student will remain\non academic probation until they meet expectations as discussed with and\noutlined by the graduate deans.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program\n\nThe Institute offers graduate programs in aerospace leading to the degrees of\nMaster of Science in Aeronautics and Space Engineering, and Doctor of\nPhilosophy in Aeronautics and Space Engineering. The programs are designed to\nprovide intense education in the foundations of the aeronautical and space\nsciences, with emphasis on research and analytical, computational, and\nexperimental methods. Entering graduate students should have a thorough\nbackground in undergraduate mathematics, physics, and engineering science.\n\nIn working toward a degree in aerospace, a student may pursue major study in\none of the following areas: physics of fluids, physics of solids and mechanics\nof materials, structural mechanics, space technology, computational solid\nmechanics, computational and theoretical fluid dynamics, aeronautical\nengineering and propulsion, biomechanics of fluids and solids, technical fluid\nmechanics, control of aerospace systems and materials.\n\nWhile research and course work in the aerospace option at the Institute cover\na very broad range of subjects, a choice of one of the above fields allows\nstudents to focus their activities while taking advantage of the flexibility\noffered by the breadth of interests of the Graduate aerospace Laboratories\n(GALCIT).\n\nIn consultation with their adviser, students will design a program of study in\none of the above fields, consisting of the fundamental courses described in\nthe regulations for the separate degrees listed below, and of electives\nselected from the list of aerospace-related courses. This will ensure that the\ngraduating student will be well-qualified for a career in aerospace and\nrelated fields.\n\n##  Examinations, Committees, and Student Responsibilities\n\nTo help students achieve satisfactory progress in their academic pursuits, the\naerospace faculty provides for the following committee and individual support.\n\nUpon beginning the first year of the aerospace program, each student is\nassigned a faculty (course) adviser whose research field matches the interests\nof the student as described in the student\u2019s statement of purpose in their\nadmissions application. The first-year adviser will guide the student in\nchoosing a set of courses appropriate to the students\u2019 interests while\nensuring the first-year academic requirements (see below) are met.\n\nStudents wishing to pursue studies leading to the Ph.D. must select and be\naccepted by a research adviser by the end of the spring term of the first year\nof residence and are required to pass a qualifying examination in the first\nterm of the second year. Having passed the qualifying examination, the student\npursues research under the supervision of the research adviser until they are\nready to enter candidacy for the Ph.D. At this point, a four-member Candidacy\nExamination Committee that includes the student\u2019s research adviser is\nassembled and administers a Candidacy Examination to ensure the student has\nthe appropriate knowledge and tools to successfully complete their chosen\nresearch activities. The Candidacy Committee is chaired by a faculty member\nother than the research adviser. The Candidacy Examination should be\nadministered by the start of the second term of the third year of residence,\nbut in any case, must be successfully completed by the end of that year in\norder to comply with Institute requirements.\n\nConferral of the Ph.D. degree is contingent on satisfactorily passing the\nthesis examination before a committee consisting of four examiners, which may,\nbut does not need to, have the same membership as the Candidacy Committee.\nStudents may find further information concerning special option requirements\nand the requisite option forms on the GALCIT website.\n\n##  AE Master\u2019s Degrees\n\n###  Master\u2019s Degree in Aeronautics and Master\u2019s Degree in Space Engineering\n\nThe master\u2019s degree program in aeronautics or space engineering is a one-year\nprogram that provides advanced training in the areas of aeronautics or space\nengineering beyond that covered in a four-year undergraduate program. The\nprogram consists of a set of five core courses (see details below). There is\nno research requirement, nor is a thesis required to obtain the degree. The\ncourses required for the master\u2019s degree must be completed in one year.\n\n###  Admission\n\nStudents whose highest qualification is a baccalaureate degree equivalent to\nthat given by the Institute are eligible to seek admission to work toward the\nmaster\u2019s degree. Students are asked to submit course transcripts and letters\nof recommendation as well as evidence of English language proficiency as\ndetailed in the graduate application. Submission of GRE exam scores is\noptional for the 2024 admissions process in aerospace. It should be noted that\nthe graduate program at GALCIT is primarily focused on Ph.D.-level research\nand so priority in admission is given to those who plan to ultimately perform\nPh.D.-level research.\n\n###  Course Requirements\n\nA program of study consists of courses totaling at least 135 units; of these,\nat least 81 units must be chosen from one of the following curricular tracks:\n\n####  Aeronautics track\n\nTwo 27-unit course sequences chosen from:\n\n  * Fluid mechanics (Ae/APh/CE/ME 101 abc)\n  * Solid/structural mechanics (Ae/AM/CE/ME 102abc)\n  * Autonomy and control (CDS 131 or Ae103a in first term, Ae 103b in second term, and a third course selected from department list in coordination with first-year adviser), 27 units\n\nExperimental methods (Ae 104abc), 27 units.\n\n####  Space Engineering track\n\nTwo 27-unit course sequences chosen from:\n\n  * Fluid mechanics (Ae/APh/CE/ME 101 abc)\n  * Solid/structural mechanics (Ae/AM/CE/ME 102abc)\n  * Autonomy and control (CDS 131 or Ae103a in first term, Ae 103b in second term, and a third course selected from department list in coordination with first-year adviser), 27 units\n\nSpace engineering (Ae 105abc), 27 units\n\nAerospace students in either the Aeronautics or Space Engineering track are\nrequired to enroll in a sequence of mathematics courses totaling 27 units\nappropriate to the student\u2019s chosen track and selected in coordination with\ntheir first-year advisers. Examples of appropriate courses include ACM/IDS\n104, ACM 100ab, ACM 101ab, etc.\n\nExamples of appropriate third courses for the Autonomy and Control sequence\ninclude Ae115, CDS 110, CDS 232, CDS 242, CDS 244, etc.\n\nFinally, all first-year students are required to enroll in aerospace\nEngineering Seminar (3 units Ae 150abc).\n\nA grade of C or higher must be achieved in all the required classes unless\nthey are only offered pass/fail, in which case a pass must be achieved in each\nclass. For both the Aeronautics and Space Engineering master\u2019s degrees, the\nremaining 27 units are elective and are to be chosen from courses at Caltech\nthat support the broader goals of the respective programs, subject to the\napproval of the student\u2019s adviser. Students must have a proposed program of\ncourses approved by their adviser prior to registration for the first term of\nwork toward the degree.\n\n###  Admission to More Advanced Degrees\n\nStudents who successfully complete the requirements for the master\u2019s degree\nand who wish to pursue the more advanced degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n(Ph.D.) must file a petition to continue work toward the desired degree. All\nstudents working for the Ph.D. degree are expected to register for and attend\nthe advanced seminar (Ae 208 abc) for a period of at least two years.\n\n##  AE Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\n###  Admission\n\nStudents with a baccalaureate degree equivalent to that given by the Institute\nare eligible to seek admission to work toward the degree of doctor of\nphilosophy (Ph.D.) in aeronautics or space engineering. Students are asked to\nsubmit course transcripts and letters of recommendation as well as evidence of\nEnglish language proficiency as detailed in the graduate application.\nSubmission of GRE exam scores is optional for the 2024 admissions process in\naerospace.\n\n###  Course Requirements\n\nThe course requirements for the first year of the Ph.D. degree are identical\nto those of the master\u2019s degree. Students admitted to graduate study for the\nPh.D. degree must complete in their first year a course of study that would\nqualify them for the master\u2019s degree described above. The student may elect to\nreceive the master\u2019s degree at the end of their first year after completion of\nthese courses.\n\n###  Research Adviser\n\nStudents wishing to pursue studies leading to the Ph.D. must select and be\naccepted by a research adviser preferably by the end of their third quarter\nbut no later than the end of their first year of study and prior to taking the\nqualifying examination described below.\n\n###  Qualifying Examination\n\nAfter the first year of graduate study, the student must pass a qualifying\nexamination. The objective of the qualifying examination is to determine if\nthe student is properly prepared and qualified to pursue problems typical of\nPh.D.-level research by demonstrating fundamental understanding of the first\nyear courses in the topic area of the exam. The exam also evaluates effective\noral communication of technical material as a skill that is required for\nprofessional development.\n\nThe exam will cover the following subjects:\n\n  1. **_Aeronautics track._**  \nTwo areas chosen from options a-c below:\n\n    1. Fluid mechanics\n    2. Solid/structural mechanics\n    3. Autonomy and control  \nand a third exam in Mathematics  \n\n  2. ** _Space Engineering track._**  \nTwo areas chosen from options a-c below:\n\n    1. Fluid mechanics\n    2. Solid/structural mechanics\n    3. Autonomy and control  \nand a third exam in Mathematics  \n\nThe material covered in these examinations is at the same general level and\nbreadth as covered in the corresponding first-year courses. The examinations\nare typically offered during one week in the first half of the fall term, in\nthe second year of graduate residence at the Institute. A student is examined\norally on all topics. In the event of an unsatisfactory performance, the\nexamining faculty members may permit a repeat examination in the appropriate\ntopics. The repeat examination must be scheduled prior to finals week of the\nwinter term and must be completed before the end of the spring term of the\nsame year.\n\n##  Graduate Teaching Assignment Duties\n\nGALCIT provides opportunities to students to improve their teaching and\ncommunication skills that are valuable in many contexts. Ph.D. students are\nrequired to perform a minimum of 18 term hours of Graduate Teaching Assistant\n(GTA) duties within the aerospace Department during their terms of residence.\nGTA duties will be assigned after the first year in residence and will be\nbased on courses a student has completed.\n\n###  Candidacy\n\nTo be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. in aerospace, the applicant must\n\n  * have satisfactorily completed at least 135 units of graduate work equivalent to the above Master of Science program;\n  * pass, with a grade of C or better, 27 units of graduate-level mathematics courses beyond ACM 95/100, and ACM/IDS 104;\n  * complete (with a grade of C or better, or Pass if the course is only offered Pass/Fail) at least 45 units of aerospace courses numbered Ae 200 or higher, or Ae/ME 118, Ae/ME 120, EE/Ae 157, Ae 159, Ae/Ge/ME 160 and Ae/CE 165ab, excluding research and seminars;  \nand\n\n  * complete three units of the advanced seminar Ae 208.\n\nA proposed program conforming to the above regulations must be approved by the\nstudent\u2019s adviser and the option representative prior to add day of the first\nterm of work toward the degree.\n\nIn addition to fulfilling these course requirements, the applicant must pass a\ncandidacy examination in the third year of residence at the Institute. This\nexam should be administered by the start of the second quarter of the third\nyear of residency. This examination aims at determining whether the student is\nsuccessful in integrating formal course work into a mature understanding of\nfundamental engineering concepts, and at demonstrating their professional\ncompetence in applying these concepts to the problems being addressed in the\ncourse of their Ph.D. research.\n\n###  Minor\n\nNo minor is required for the Ph.D. degree. Students are, however, encouraged\nto take advanced courses appropriate to their particular interests or pursue a\nminor in consultation with their adviser.  \n\n##  Foreign Languages\n\nStudents are encouraged to discuss with their adviser the desirability of\nstudying foreign languages, but there is no formal foreign language\nrequirement for the Ph.D.  \n\n##  Thesis and Final Examination\n\nPrior to graduation, each candidate is required to give a seminar presenting\nthe results of their thesis research. For final examination and thesis\ncompletion, see also the general degree requirements and the section on\n[Examinations, Committees, and Student\nResponsibilities](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/information-for-\ngraduate-students/special-regulations-for-graduate-options/aerospace-\nae/#examinations-committees-and-student-responsibilities) regarding aerospace.\nFor a description of the Institute requirements for conferral of a Ph.D. see\n[Degree of Doctor of\nPhilosophy](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/information-for-graduate-\nstudents/general-requirements-for-graduate-degrees/#degree-of-doctor-of-\nphilosophy).\n\n**Subject Minor**\n\nA student majoring in a field other than aerospace may, with the approval of\nthe option representative, elect aerospace as a subject minor. A minimum of 54\nunits in subjects acceptable to the aerospace faculty is required.\n\n**Problem and Grievance Resolution within aerospace**  \nStudents may pursue several avenues for redress concerning personal and\nacademic problems that may arise during their residency, as outlined by the\nStudent Problem Resolution Process described earlier in the catalog. Should a\nstudent not wish to discuss the relevant issues with their adviser, the option\nrepresentative and/or the director are always available to meet with the\nstudent. In addition, two other resources are available, one at the student\nand one at the faculty level. A student representative is elected annually by\nthe aerospace graduate students at or after the Information Session, which is\npart of Ae 150. In the event that the student representative has completed\ntheir Ph.D. studies before the election date and left the Institute, the\nstudent organizer for Ae 150 may be their replacement. A faculty member chosen\nby the aerospace faculty to provide support for the students is available for\nstudent contact. The names of the current student and faculty support persons\nare available in the aerospace office.\n\n**Educational Exchange Program with \u00c9cole Polytechnique**  \nAn educational exchange program is offered by the aerospace option with \u00c9cole\nPolytechnique (EP). In this exchange program, students selected for\nparticipation from Caltech will enroll for one year at EP. Correspondingly,\nstudents selected for the program from EP will enroll for one year at Caltech.\nTo be eligible to participate, aerospace students must have completed one full\nyear of study (for Caltech students this is equivalent to the requirements for\nthe M.S. degree) and agree that they will spend one full year at EP. First\nyear (G1) graduate students enrolled in Caltech\u2019s doctoral aerospace program\nwill be apprised of the opportunity to participate in an educational exchange\nprogram at the master\u2019s level at EP. A maximum of two student(s) will be\nselected by the aerospace faculty from the pool of students who express\ninterest in this program. Caltech students will follow their first (master\u2019s)\nyear at Caltech, and their second year in the second-year master\u2019s (M2)\nprogram at EP. Caltech students must fulfill the requirements of their first-\nyear program and receive their Caltech M.S. diploma prior to proceeding to EP.\n\nCaltech students must register at Caltech during the year spent at \u00c9cole\nPolytechnique and enroll in the special topics course Ae 240 \u2013 Educational\nexchange at \u00c9cole Polytechnique. This ensures that they maintain their\nstanding as enrolled graduate students at Caltech. It is implied that classes\ntaken at one institution cannot duplicate classes already taken at the other\ninstitution. The expectation is that Caltech students will return to Caltech\nafter completing the EP program and continue with their doctoral studies at\nCaltech. Caltech students should be prepared to take the qualifying exams in\nthe fall term when they return from EP. Caltech students participating in the\nCaltech/EP educational exchange program will be considered to be on detached\nduty from Caltech while at EP. A detached duty agreement will be executed for\neach student that spells out the terms and requirements for the detached duty.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program\n\nCaltech\u2019s Computing & Mathematical Sciences department offers an\ninterdisciplinary program of graduate study in applied and computational\nmathematics leading to the Ph.D. degree. This program is designed to give\nstudents a thorough training in fundamental computational and applied\nmathematics and to develop their research ability in a specific application\nfield. The training essential for future careers in applied mathematics in\nacademia, national laboratories, or in industry is provided by completion of\nthe requirements for a Ph.D. degree in applied and computational mathematics.\n\nThe research areas and interests of the applied and computational mathematics\nfaculty cover a broad spectrum representing the use of ideas from across the\nmathematical sciences to formulate, analyze, and develop algorithms for\nmathematical models. As reflected by the faculty research activities, there is\na strong emphasis on computational methods and theoretical analysis for\nsolving challenging problems arising from applications in engineering, the\nsciences, and the social sciences.\n\nReflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the program, several different\ngroups, in addition to the applied and computational mathematics faculty,\ncontribute to the teaching and supervision of research. Students in applied\nand computational mathematics are expected to combine their basic mathematical\nstudies with deep involvement in some field of application. Basic general\ncourses are listed specifically under applied and computational mathematics,\nand these are to be supplemented, according to the student\u2019s interest, from\nthe whole range of Institute courses in engineering, the sciences, and the\nsocial sciences.\n\nA regular colloquium provides the opportunity for visitors, faculty, and\nstudents to discuss current research. In addition there are numerous other\nspecialized seminars linked to ACM.\n\n###  Admission\n\nEach new graduate student admitted to work towards the Ph.D. in applied and\ncomputational mathematics selects course work in consultation with their\nadvisor based on the student\u2019s background and interests. The work of the\nstudent during the first year will usually include some independent reading\nand/or research.\n\n###  Course Requirements\n\nDuring their graduate study, all ACM students are required to take a total of\n12 graduate courses of 9+ units each, selected in consultation with their\nadvisor. The courses ACM/IDS 104, ACM/EE/IDS 116, IDS/ACM/CS 157, IDS/ACM/CS\n158, ACM 190, and CMS 290 will not count toward the Ph.D. requirements. The 12\nclasses must include no fewer than 3 from the core set (ACM/IDS 101ab, ACM/EE\n106ab, CMS/ACM/IDS 107a, CMS/ACM 117, ACM 118, CMS/ACM/EE 122); no fewer than\n6 from the the core set together with any other ACM 100+ classes; and no fewer\nthan 9 from the previous sets together with any 100+ level classes in\nEE/CMS/CS/Math. The remaining classes will be selected among all level 100+\nclasses from any option. Three of the core classes are selected by the\nstudent, in consultation with their advisor, as the subject matter considered\nfor the qualifying examination. This written exam is administered shortly\nbefore the start of the beginning of the second year of study, typically\nduring the month of September (see below). In addition, CMS 290 is required\nfor all first year ACM graduate students during each term\n(fall/winter/spring).\n\n##  ACM Master\u2019s Degree\n\nStudents are not admitted to work toward the master\u2019s degree. The master\u2019s\ndegree may be awarded to an ACM student only in exceptional circumstances. Of\nthe 135 units of graduate work required by Institute regulations, at least 81\nunits of advanced graduate work should be in applied mathematics.\n\n##  ACM Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\n###  The Preliminary Examination.\n\nShortly before the beginning of the second year (typically September), all\nfirst year students must take a written preliminary examination administered\nby the faculty. Its purpose is to ensure a solid and broad knowledge in\napplied and computational mathematics, and in the event of a deficiency, to\ndirect the students to necessary courses and reading.\n\n###  The Candidacy Examination\n\nTo be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in applied and\ncomputational mathematics, all students must, in addition to meeting the\ngeneral Institute requirements and passing the preliminary examination, pass a\ncandidacy examination administered by a committee that consists of at least\nfour faculty, is approved by the option representative, and is chaired by the\nstudent\u2019s research advisor. The examination will ascertain the student\u2019s\nbreadth and depth of preparation for research in the chosen area. The\nexamination must be taken within the first three years of residence.\n\n###  Advising and Thesis Supervision\n\nUpon passing the preliminary examination, the student is required to choose a\nthesis supervisor who assumes the major responsibility in supervising the\nPh.D. thesis. At the same time, an advising committee consisting of three\nfaculty members is formed to help oversee the advising process. This committee\nshould be formed no later than the third year of graduate study. The student\u2019s\nsupervisor is part of this committee, but does not chair the committee. The\nstudent is encouraged to meet with the committee members informally for advice\nor suggestions. Joint supervision between two faculty members is also\npossible, as is seeking a thesis adviser outside the core applied and\ncomputational mathematics option, although in this case it is mandatory that\nan applied mathematics faculty member be nominated as a co-adviser.\n\nShould a disagreement of any kind occur between the student and their\nsupervisor as regards the timely completion of the thesis, the student is\nencouraged to direct their concerns to the committee chair. If this is not\nworkable, the student should feel free to consult with the option\nrepresentative, the executive officer, or an applied and computational\nmathematics faculty member of the student\u2019s choice. If the student\u2019s concerns\ncannot be resolved through consultation with these individuals, the student is\nencouraged to pursue resolution of their concerns through other channels as\noutlined in the [Student Problem Resolution\nProcess](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/general-information/notices-and-\nagreements/#student-problem-resolution-process).\n\nAcademic progress will be reviewed regularly, including at least once annually\nby the option representative.\n\nAn ability to explain concepts and to verbally present one\u2019s work is vital to\na successful career in research and/or teaching. To this end, students may be\nrequired by their advisor and the option representative to occasionally serve\nas a teaching assistant.\n\n###  Final Examination\n\nThe final oral examination is held within four weeks after the submission of\nthe thesis. The examination covers the thesis and related areas.  \n\n##  ACM Subject Minor\n\nThe group of courses must differ markedly from the major subject of study, and\nmust include 54 units of advanced courses in applied mathematics and must not\nbe simultaneously used for fulfilling a requirement of the second option. The\nqualifying courses exclude ACM 95/100, although some flexibility is allowed\ndepending upon the option of origin. The student must pass an oral examination\nwhose subject is directly related to the material covered in the qualifying\ncourses. This oral examination will be waived if the student has received a\ngrade of A in every course.\n\n"

The degrees of Doctor of Philosophy\n(Ph.D.) and Master of Science (M.S.) are offered. In general, students who\nintend to work full-time toward the Ph.D. degree as a final degree objective\nare admitted to the Applied Mechanics Graduate Program. The M.S. degree is\ntypically only awarded to students who pursue the Ph.D. degree in applied\nmechanics at Caltech and who do not already have an M.S. degree in applied\nmechanics.\n\nThe aim of the graduate program in applied mechanics at Caltech is to prepare\nstudents for research and professional practice in an era of rapidly advancing\ninterdisciplinary technology. The program combines individual depth of\nexperience and competence in a particular chosen major specialty, with a\nstrong background in the basic and engineering sciences. It strives to develop\nprofessional independence, creativity, leadership, and the capacity for\ncontinuing professional and intellectual growth.\n\n##  AM Preparation for the Graduate Program\n\nEntering graduate students are expected to have a thorough background in\nundergraduate mathematics, physics, and engineering. While a strong\nundergraduate program in applied mechanics should provide a suitable\npreparation, students who have not specialized in applied mechanics as\nundergraduates may also be admitted for graduate study. For example, an\noutstanding four-year undergraduate program in mathematics and sciences may\nprovide a suitable background as well. The qualifications of each applicant\nwill be considered individually, and, after being enrolled, the student will\narrange their program in consultation with a member of the faculty.\n\n##  AM Master\u2019s Degree\n\nThe degree of Master of Science in applied mechanics is only awarded to\nstudents who do not already have an M.S. degree in applied mechanics. The\ndegree will be awarded upon request by students who have fulfilled the\nrequirements. Only in exceptional cases is there admission to the M.S. program\nas the final degree objective.\n\nA minimum of 138 units of courses numbered 100 or above, which meet the\nrequired master\u2019s program listed below, must be passed with a grade of at\nleast C for completion of the master\u2019s degree in applied mechanics. All units\nmust be taken for grades, except for courses offered only on a pass/fail\nbasis. The M.S. degree in applied mechanics is typically completed within the\nfirst two years of residency at Caltech.\n\nEach student\u2019s program must be approved by the adviser and option\nrepresentative in mechanical and civil engineering before registering for the\ncourse.\n\n###  Required Master\u2019s Program\n\n  1.

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program\n\nApplied physics is a broad field of study that lies at the intersection of\nphysics and many other fields of science and engineering. The applied physics\noption at Caltech is accordingly a highly multidisciplinary program that is\ndesigned to train students in a broad spectrum of physics and engineering\nfields at an advanced level. Moreover, it is our goal to cultivate abilities\nin our graduates to apply this knowledge throughout their lives so as to make\ntechnological and scientific breakthroughs at the edge of current knowledge.\n\n##  APh Preparation for the Graduate Program\n\nStudents admitted for graduate study can enter from a broad range of\ndisciplines, but are expected to have a rigorous background in undergraduate\nmathematics, physics, and engineering. An outstanding four-year undergraduate\nprogram in mathematics and sciences may provide a suitable background as well.\nThe qualifications of each applicant will be considered individually. After\nenrollment, the student will arrange a course of study and research in\nconsultation with members of the faculty and the applied physics option\nrepresentative.\n\n##  APh Description of the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)\n\nTo receive the doctoral degree in applied physics students must demonstrate\nthe ability to formulate and execute an original program of scientific study.\nAs part of this, a doctoral candidate is expected to develop a deep\nunderstanding in a chosen field of specialization; to develop tools with which\nto assess problems outside one\u2019s field of specialization; to develop rigor and\nstrength in the physical sciences for self-education beyond formal training;\nand to develop skills to become a productive member of the community of\nscholars. All students wishing to enter the program must complete a series of\npreparatory courses, followed by an oral candidacy exam in which the student\ndescribes their proposed topic of research and is examined on their knowledge\nof course subject matter. Upon passing the candidacy examination, students\nwork towards completion of a thesis in consultation with their research\nadviser. The doctoral degree is awarded upon approval of a written thesis by a\nfaculty committee, and successful defense of the thesis in a final oral\nexamination. There is no separate master\u2019s program in applied physics.\nHowever, with the approval of the student\u2019s adviser and the applied physics\noption representative, the degree of Master of Science in Applied Physics may\nbe awarded after the fulfillment of the course requirements described below.\n\n##  APh Advising and Thesis Supervision\n\nAn interim adviser is appointed for each student upon admission to the\ngraduate program in applied physics. Typically, this person is the applied\nphysics option representative. In consultation with the interim adviser the\nstudent will determine a course schedule and identify a faculty research\nadviser. This most often occurs within the first six months of graduate\nresidence. The faculty adviser is the student\u2019s primary mentor and the student\nwill work in the adviser\u2019s research group to formulate and execute a plan of\nstudy leading to the thesis. In consultation with their research adviser, the\nstudent will also form a Ph.D. Thesis Advisory Committee. This four-member\ncommittee should include the student\u2019s adviser and at least three members of\nthe Caltech professorial faculty from either the applied physics or physics\noptions. The Thesis Advisory Committee will conduct the qualifying examination\nand also approve the thesis and conduct the thesis defense. The membership of\nthis committee may change between the time of the qualifying exam and the\nfinal defense.\n\n##  APh Requirements for Candidacy to the Ph.D. Degree\n\nTo be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in applied physics, a\nstudent must demonstrate mastery in the following five areas of pure and\napplied physics:\n\n  * Classical Physics: Mechanics and Electromagnetism\n  * Quantum Mechanics\n  * Mathematical Methods\n  * Statistical Physics and Thermodynamics\n  * Biophysics, Optical Physics, Hydrodynamics, Plasma Physics, or Solid-State Physics\n\n###  A. Graduate Coursework toward Candidacy\n\nIn partial fulfillment of the \u201cmastery\u201d requirement a student must\nsuccessfully complete a minimum of 108 units of courses numbered 101 or above\nfrom the course schedule. In addition, 4 units of APh 110ab must also be\ncompleted. All courses must be passed with a grade of at least a C, except for\ncourses offered only on a pass/fail basis. Students must also complete the\ndegree progress report online upon completion of their courses.\n\nNote: Any given class can only be used for one requirement category.\n\n|  _Total Units_  \n---|---  \n**1\\.

In\nsuch cases, students may petition the Applied Physics option representative to\naccept alternate subjects or areas. These changes should retain core applied\nphysics knowledge, and maintain sufficient breadth. All such petitions must be\nsubmitted to the option representative and approved before the student\nregisters for the course.\n\nCoursework towards the Ph.D. degree in Applied Physics is normally completed\nwithin the first two years of graduate residency.\n\n###  B. Candidacy Examination\n\nTo fulfill the requirements for candidacy all students must pass an oral\nexamination after completing their coursework. This examination must be taken\nbefore the beginning of the student\u2019s third year in residence. Students will\nbe expected to deliver a half-hour oral presentation giving a prospectus on\ntheir proposed thesis research. Following questions on the research\nprospectus, a more open-ended set of questions will be posed to the student by\nthe committee members to test general proficiency in the five areas of pure\nand applied physics listed above. Students who fail the oral examination on\ntheir first attempt will be given additional guidelines for further study and\nan opportunity to retake the examination a second and final time if the\ncommittee so recommends. Students who fail the oral examination a second time\ncannot continue with doctoral studies leading to the Ph.D. Upon recommendation\nof the examining committee, however, a student may be granted a master\u2019s\ndegree. Annual approval of the applied physics option representative is\nnecessary for registration beyond the third year of graduate residence if the\nstudent has not completed the candidacy examination.\n\nStudents who fulfill the requirements above will be recommended for candidacy\nto the doctoral program and a master\u2019s degree (if applicable) in applied\nphysics.\n\n##  APh Ph.D. Thesis Requirements\n\nThe candidate is to provide a draft copy of the completed thesis to the\nmembers of the examining committee (typically the same as the thesis\ncommittee) at least two weeks before the final oral examination. The date of\nthe examination and the composition of the examining committee will not be\napproved by the dean of graduate studies until the thesis is submitted in\ncompleted form, i.e., ready for review by the dean, the members of the thesis\ncommittee, and the Graduate Office proofreader. Registration is required for\nthe term in which the thesis defense is taken, but is not normally allowed\nbeyond the last date of the term. For more information, please see the section\nentitled \u201cInformation for Graduate Students\u201d in the _Caltech Catalog_.\n\n##  APh Ph.D. Final Examination\n\nThe candidate shall undergo a final broad oral examination (thesis defense) in\nthe field, to include the subspecialty represented by the thesis and the\nsignificance of its findings to the field. This oral examination will be\nadministered at least two weeks after the doctoral thesis has been presented\nin final form so that the examining committee has sufficient time to review\nits content. This examination must be taken at least three weeks prior to the\ndate on which the degree will be officially conferred.\n\n##  APh Registration Beyond the Sixth Year of Graduate Residence\n\nThe annual approval of the student\u2019s Thesis Advisory Committee is necessary\nfor registration beyond the twenty-fourth academic term of graduate residence\nat Caltech.\n\n##  APh Subject Minor\n\nGraduate students majoring in other fields may elect a minor in applied\nphysics. In addition to general Institute requirements, the student must\ncomplete, with a grade of C or higher, 81 units of courses in applied physics\nabove the 100 level, excluding APh 200. The minor is also subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\n  * Students cannot use courses required by their major option in fulfillment of this requirement.\n  * Students interested in a minor must receive prior approval from the option representative in applied physics, who will review and approve the proposed course of study.\n  * It is recommended that this course of study include advanced courses spanning different subfields of applied physics.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program\n\nThe primary aim of the graduate astrophysics program at Caltech is to prepare\nstudents for creative and productive careers in astrophysical research and a\nvariety of other challenging vocations. The astrophysics program emphasizes\nindependent research by graduate students, who are free to pursue study in\nvirtually any area of astrophysics. The opportunity exists to take advantage\nof the many [observational facilities owned and operated by\nCaltech](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/areas-of-study-and-\nresearch/aerospace/#physical-facilities).\n\n##  Ay Admission\n\nIncoming students should have a strong background in physics. Although\npreparation in astronomy is helpful, this is not required for admission to the\ngraduate program. In addition to demonstrating academic readiness, applicants\nshould provide evidence of research readiness.\n\n##  Ay Master\u2019s Degree\n\nWhile the option does not offer a master\u2019s degree program in itself, students\nwho fulfill the general Institute requirements for such a degree, and the\nspecific option requirements (see below), can receive a master\u2019s degree. This\nmay be either en route to a final Ph.D. degree if admitted to candidacy, or as\na terminal degree if the Ph.D. requirements are not met.\n\nThe choice of astronomy and other science elective courses must be approved by\nthe option representative. At least 54 units of the 135 units must be selected\nfrom Ay 121\u2013127, with at least 36 units earned with a grade of B- or better.\nThe courses Ph 106, Ph 125, and Ph 129 may be required of those students whose\nprevious training in some of these subjects proves to be insufficient. At\nleast 27 units of advanced courses in fields other than astronomy are\nrequired.\n\n##  Ay Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\nThe student\u2019s proposed overall program of study must be approved by the option\nrepresentative during the first year.\n\n###  Astrophysics Core Program\n\nThe following are required of all students for candidacy: Ay 121, Ay 123, Ay\n124, Ay 125, Ay 126, and Ay 127. The student should take these courses in the\nfirst year. Students must also take at least one term of Ay 122 unless\nexempted. Also required are research and reading projects. Credit for this\nwork will be given under Ay 142 and Ay 143. The above courses must be passed\nwith a grade of B\u2013 or better.\n\n##  Electives Program\n\nThe first two years of graduate study should include at least four courses (36\nunits) of additional electives relevant to astrophysics, with six courses (54\nunits) required of theory students. The electives requirement may be reduced\nfor students who need to take Ph 106, Ph 125 or Ph 129 in order to make up for\ngaps in preparation at the undergraduate level.\n\nSuggested elective courses include, but are not limited to: Ph 101, Ph 105,\nPh/Aph 118 a, Ph 127 b, Ph 135, Ph 136 ab, Ph 236 a, Ph 237. For theory\nstudents, Ph 136 a and Ph 136 b are required with Ph 136 c and Ph 101 highly\nrecommended, and in addition to Ph, electives in applied mathematics should be\nconsidered. For students in observation and experiment, Ph 136 a and Ph 136 b\nare strongly recommended, and in any case at least one of the four advanced\ncourse electives must be in Ph, while the complement may be from other options\nsuch as electrical engineering, applied mechanics, computer science, planetary\nscience (geophysics or geochemistry). Seminar courses and research practicum\ncourses do not count as satisfying the requirement for pedagogical elective\ncoursework; however, students are encouraged to take these types of courses\nduring second year. No more than 18 of the elective units may be taken P/F;\nall others must be passed with a grade of C or better. In the third year and\nabove, students are welcome to enroll in additional advanced astronomy and\nphysics courses.\n\n###  Other Requirements\n\nEach term, the student must be registered for at least 36 academic units, with\nadditional electives such as from PA/PE/HSS allowed on top of the 36. An\nability to explain concepts and to verbally present one\u2019s work is vital to a\nsuccessful career in research and/or teaching. To this end, all graduate\nstudents in Astrophysics are required to serve as teaching assistants during\ntheir second year, and to make oral presentations as part of the course Ay\n141, which must be taken every term during the academic year by all students,\nbeginning in their second year and continuing through graduation.\n\nGraduate students for whom English is a second language may be required to\ndemonstrate fluency in oral and written English at the time of their candidacy\nexam. The examining committee will arrange for an evaluation if this is deemed\nnecessary.\n\n###  Admission to Candidacy\n\nTo be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in astrophysics, a\nstudent must, in addition to meeting the general Institute requirements:\n\n  * pass satisfactorily, or by special examination, the required astrophysics courses (see above);\n  * pass a general oral qualifying examination (see below);\n  * complete the physics-based electives course requirement (see above);\n  * satisfy a teaching requirement (generally two-three terms as a graduate teaching assistant);\n  * fulfill the language requirement if applicable (see above);\n  * complete satisfactorily 36 units of research (Ay 142) or reading (Ay143);\n  * be accepted for thesis research by a member of the faculty.\n  * pass a thesis candidacy examination (see below).\n\nIn fall of their second year, all students are required to take a general oral\nqualifying examination. Students will be examined on the substance and status\nof, as well as their performance on, a research project, which should be\nstarted not later than the summer following the first year. They will further\nbe examined on their broad understanding of current topics in, and\nfundamentals of, astrophysics. Both of these aspects of the examination are\nintended to evaluate the candidate\u2019s aptitude for a research career in\nastrophysics. In addition, at the discretion of the executive officer,\nstudents who have not done well in one, or at most two, areas covered in the\nAy 12x course series during their first year will be retested in these areas\nduring the examination. Students must pass all of the aspects of this\nexamination, as judged by the faculty committee conducting it, in order to\ncontinue in the Ph.D. program.\n\nStudents who do not meet the minimum grade requirements in the Ay 121\u2013127\nseries, or who do not pass the general candidacy examination described above,\nwill not be able to continue in the Ph.D. program. They may receive a terminal\nmaster\u2019s degree, provided that they fulfill the requirements for it (see\nabove).\n\n###  Advising and Thesis Supervision\n\nBy the summer of their first year, students should be spending most of their\ntime on research. During their first two years, students are free to work with\nany faculty they wish, on one or more projects. However, by the summer of\ntheir second year at the latest, they should have defined a thesis project and\nbeen accepted by a faculty research adviser for that project (in cases where\nthe thesis involves multiple projects, a second faculty adviser may supervise\npart of the research, but one must be selected as primary adviser). An oral\ncandidacy exam dealing with the student\u2019s proposed thesis research should be\ncompleted before the end of the third year. The date and time of the exam are\nthe responsibility of the student to arrange. The candidacy committee is\napproved by the option representative in consultation with the student\u2019s\nadviser and informed by a list of suggested members provided by the student.\nThis committee becomes the student\u2019s Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC) and will\nstand until the final oral thesis defense, and be charged with ensuring that\nsatisfactory progress toward the Ph.D. is being made.\n\nIf the candidate does not pass the oral candidacy exam, then the candidacy\ncommittee may at its discretion offer the candidate a second oral examination.\nThis examination must be successfully completed by the end of the third term\nof the third year.\n\nAfter the oral candidacy exam, the adviser and the student together have\nprimary responsibility for the student\u2019s progress and career development. To\nensure that these remain on course, both student and adviser must submit\nannual progress reports to a representative of the astrophysics program (the\noption representative, the executive officer, or in the case of a conflict of\ninterest, to the division chair). Furthermore, the student should meet for a\n\u201ccheck-in\u201d with the thesis advisory committee members at least once per year.\nIf at any stage the student or the adviser feels that there are serious\nproblems developing, they may consult in confidence with the astrophysics\noption representative, the executive officer, or the division chair. They may\nalso request a meeting of the committee or seek the advice or help of other\nfaculty members. Students may also consult at any time with the PMA director\nof student programming or seek confidential advice and help from the Student\nWellness Services.\n\n###  Final Examination (Ph.D. Oral Thesis Defense)\n\nA final draft of the thesis must be submitted to the registrar at least six\nweeks before the commencement at which the degree is to be conferred. At least\ntwo weeks after submission of the thesis, the student will be examined orally\non the scope of the thesis and its relation to current research in\nastrophysics. The examination will be conducted by a committee selected in the\nsame way as the candidacy committee, and is nominally the thesis advisory\ncommittee. The oral thesis defense should occur before the end of the fifth\nyear.\n\n###  Typical Timeline\n\nYear 1: Ay 121, Ay 123\u2013127; at least two advanced physics courses; reading and\nindependent study. Begin research.\n\nYear 2: Early fall\u2014general oral qualifying examination. Fulfill teaching\nrequirement. Complete 36 units of physics (54 for theorists); a term of Ay 122\nif applicable; optional advanced astronomy courses. Ay 141 each term. Research\nprojects; select thesis and adviser.\n\nYear 3: Complete oral candidacy exam on proposed thesis before end of third\nterm. Submit annual report to option representative. Ay 141. Optional Advanced\nCourses\n\nYear 4: Submit annual report. Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC) check-in. Ay\n141.\n\nYear 5: Submit annual report. Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC) check-in. Ay\n141.

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program\n\nAn integrated approach to graduate study in biochemistry and molecular\nbiophysics has been organized primarily by the Divisions of Biology and\nBiological Engineering (BBE) and Chemistry and Chemical Engineering (CCE). The\ncurriculum is designed to provide a broad background in biochemistry and\nbiophysics of macromolecules and molecular assemblies, in addition to an\nappropriate depth of knowledge in the field selected for the Ph.D. thesis\nresearch.\n\n##  BMB Admission\n\nThe option in Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics is open to students with\nundergraduate degrees in biochemistry, biology, chemistry, biophysics,\nphysics, engineering, and related areas. Applicants whose native language is\nnot English may submit results of the TOEFL exam and, after admission, are\nrequired to satisfy the English language requirements of the Institute.\n\n##  BMB Master\u2019s Degree\n\nStudents are not admitted to work toward the M.S. degree. A terminal M.S.\ndegree may be awarded only in special circumstances. In addition to meeting\nInstitute requirements, a student must have formed a committee of four Caltech\nfaculty, typically the Ph.D. candidacy committee, who must approve the request\nto obtain a M.S. in consultation with the Option Representative, typically\nconferred after the end of the second year of residence.\n\n##  BMB Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\nThe option representative will counsel and oversee the student\u2019s progress upon\nadmission to the graduate program. During the first year of graduate study,\nstudents are required to participate in the BMB 202 seminar course and BMB\n174. Additionally, as noted below, the option offers a series of courses that\nwill expose the student to contemporary issues in biochemistry and molecular\nbiophysics, and to the tools and methods that are essential for research in\nthis area. Research advisers are normally selected at the end of spring\nquarter of the first year. Students are required to take five additional\nadvanced courses of nine or more units for grades that are appropriate for\ntheir research interests (as determined by the option representative).\n\n###  Teaching\n\nAll students are to serve as teaching assistants for two quarters with the\nfirst in the first year of residence and the second by the end of the fourth\nyear. In addition to serving an educational purpose, funds for the TA\nassignments are a component of the stipend. Outside factors, such as previous\nTA positions prior to starting the Ph.D. program, may be considered as\nsatisfying the requirement upon approval by the option representative.\n\n###  Laboratory Rotations\n\nIn consultation with the Option Representative and individual professors,\nstudents will choose three laboratories to do one term research projects\nduring their first year of residence. These laboratory rotations are designed\nto provide students with an introduction to different areas of biochemistry\nand molecular biophysics along with identifying a lab for thesis research. It\nis possible to waive the third rotation with permission given by petitioning\nthe Option Representative.\n\n###  Admission to Candidacy\n\nBy the end of the sixth term of residency, the student will take an oral\nexamination to assess mastery of the field of biochemistry and to evaluate\nresearch progress. As part of this examination, each student will submit a\nwritten research report summarizing the progress in their research, and an\noriginal research proposal in a field outside the student\u2019s chosen field of\nresearch. A candidacy examination committee of four to five faculty (including\nthe advisor) will be assembled by the student in consultation with their\nadvisor and approved by the Option Representative. The chair of the committee\nshould be identified at the time the committee is chosen and must be a member\nof the BMB option who is not the thesis advisor. In addition to satisfactory\ncompletion of the Candidacy exam, admission to Candidacy requires satisfactory\ncompletion of BMB 174 and five additional advanced courses of nine or more\nunits (numbered 100 or above).\n\n###  Thesis Committee and Annual Progress Meetings\n\nUpon admission to candidacy, the candidacy examination committee will become\nthe thesis advisory committee. Students are required to meet annually with\ntheir thesis advisory committee to evaluate research progress. This committee\nwill also serve as the Ph.D. thesis examination committee. A fifth member may\nbe added at this time.\n\n###  Thesis and Final Examination\n\nThesis research will be carried out under the direction of one or more faculty\nmembers in the BMB option. The thesis defense will consist of a public thesis\nseminar, followed by a closed examination by the Ph.D. thesis committee.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program\n\nBioengineering research at Caltech focuses on the application of engineering\nprinciples to the design, analysis, construction, and manipulation of\nbiological systems, and on the discovery and application of new engineering\nprinciples inspired by the properties of biological systems. Areas of research\nemphasis include: biodevices, bioimaging, bioinspired design, biomechanics,\nbiomedical engineering, cell and tissue engineering, molecular programming,\nsynthetic biology, and systems biology. The goal of the doctoral program is to\nprepare students to become leading scientists and engineers in academia and\nindustry. The graduate program aims to educate students to be highly competent\nin their chosen area of research, but also provide them with a broad knowledge\nfoundation in bioengineering. By graduation, students are expected to have a\nworking knowledge of bioengineering in general and an in-depth knowledge of\ntheir chosen area, have independently planned and conducted research\nexperiments in their chosen area, and successfully defended their thesis work\nin an open forum.\n\n##  BE Master\u2019s Degree\n\nStudents are not admitted to work toward the M.S. degree. In special\ncircumstances, the M.S. degree may be awarded, provided Institute requirements\nare met.\n\n##  BE Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\nIn addition to satisfying the general Institute requirements, candidates for a\nPh.D. in bioengineering at Caltech must satisfy the following requirements:\n\n###  Course Requirements\n\nCoursework requirements provide maximum flexibility in building on\nundergraduate training and complementing the research activities of each\nstudent. To assist in the selection of a research area, to foster interactions\nwithin the entering class, and to discuss ethical guidelines for scientific\nresearch, students participate in three required discussion courses in their\nfirst year: current research topics in Caltech bioengineering labs (BE 267,\nfirst term); Reading the Bioengineering Literature (BE 201, second term);\nResponsible Conduct of Research (Bi 252, first term). Graduate students must\ntake BE 201 again in their second year.\n\nIn addition to the required courses, students must take at least six electives\n(one-quarter courses totaling at least 54 units; grade of B or higher in each\ncourse) selected in consultation with the student\u2019s adviser and the option\nrepresentative. Two of these courses must be Bi/CNS/NB 195 and BE/Bi 103 a,\nunless the option representative deems the student\u2019s past course work to have\ncovered the topics of those courses and waives the requirement. Waived courses\ndo not count toward the requirement of six electives. To maximize the\nopportunity for research during the early stages of the graduate career,\ncoursework may be spread over the first and second years. Electives are listed\nbelow. Other courses may count as electives at the discretion of the option\nrepresentative.\n\n_Bioimaging and biomedical devices electives:_ AM/CE 151 ab, APh 109, APh/EE\n130, APh/EE 132, BE/EE/MedE 189 ab, Bi/BE 177, Bi/BE 227, APh/EE 131,\nEE/BE/MedE 185, EE/MedE 187, Ph 106 abc, Ph/APh/EE/BE 118 abc.\n\n_Biomechanics and bioinspired design electives:_ Ae/APh/CE/ME 101 abc,\nAe/AM/CE/ME 102 abc, Ae/BE 242, BE/Bi 106, BE 159, ChE 103 abc, ChE 151 ab,\nChE/Ch 164, ChE 174, MedE/BE/Ae 243, Ph 127 abc.\n\n_Synthetic biology, systems biology, molecular programming, and cell and\ntissue engineering electives:_ BE 150, BE 153, BE 159, BE/Bi/APh 161, Bi 117,\nBi 145 ab, BE/ChE 163, BE/CS/CNS/Bi 191ab, ChE 130.\n\n_Biology electives:_ BE 150, Bi/Ch 110 ab, Bi/Ch 111, Bi 114, Bi 115, Bi 117,\nBi 118, Bi 122, Bi/BE 129, Bi 145 ab, BE 153, BE 159, BE/Bi/APh 161, Bi/CNS\n150.\n\n_Math electives:_ ACM 100 ab, ACM/EE/IDS 116, ACM/ESE 118, AM 125 abc, ChE\n105, CDS 110, CDS 140.\n\n###  Research\n\nThe flexibility of the coursework requirements enables research to be the\nprimary activity from the very first term in residence. Students are\nencouraged to do two or more research rotations during the first year to\nsample research activities in multiple labs before selecting a Ph.D. adviser.\nRotations are arranged by contacting individual faculty.\n\n###  Adviser Selection\n\nEach student must select a Ph.D. adviser by the end of the spring term of the\nfirst academic year. Advisers may be any Caltech faculty member working in an\narea related to bioengineering.\n\n###  First Year Conversation\n\nBefore the end of the spring term of the first year in residence, each student\nmeets with a faculty committee for a discussion of first-year progress and\nsecond-year plans. The committee must be composed of three faculty, plus the\nPh.D. adviser(s), including a minimum of two bioengineering faculty. The\nstudent will give a brief presentation on research progress and future plans,\nas well as discuss fundamentals related to the research area.\n\n###  Teaching\n\nEach student is to serve as a teaching assistant for one quarter of their\nresidence.\n\n###  Admission to Candidacy\n\nBy the end of the spring term of the second year in residence, each student\nmust complete the coursework requirement, prepare a candidacy report, and pass\nan oral candidacy exam. The report should be brief, describing research\nprogress to date and outlining plans for the remaining doctoral research. The\ncandidacy report should be submitted to the committee members one week before\nthe oral exam. The committee must be composed of three faculty, plus the\nadviser(s), including a minimum of two bioengineering faculty. The oral\ncandidacy exam will include presentation of research progress, presentation of\na proposed outline for the thesis, and questioning on fundamentals related to\nthe research area. Students who complete the coursework requirement, prepare a\ncandidacy report, and pass the oral candidacy exam will be recommended for\ncandidacy. Students who are not admitted to candidacy by the end of the second\nyear in residence will not be permitted to register in subsequent terms except\nwith special permission from the option representative.\n\n###  Thesis Advisory Committee Meetings\n\nFollowing admission to candidacy, the doctoral student will select a Thesis\nAdvisory Committee (TAC). The committee must be composed of three faculty,\nplus the adviser(s), including a minimum of two bioengineering faculty. This\ncommittee should meet at least once each year for the remainder of the\nstudent\u2019s time at Caltech.\n\n###  Thesis Examination\n\nA final oral examination will be given after the thesis has been formally\ncompleted. The exam will consist of a public research presentation followed by\na private defense with an exam committee. The committee must be composed of\nthree faculty, plus the adviser(s), including a minimum of two Bioengineering\nfaculty. The thesis examination will be a defense of the doctoral thesis and a\ntest of the candidate\u2019s knowledge in their specialized field of research.\n\n##  BE Subject Minor\n\nA student may, with the approval of the bioengineering graduate option\nrepresentative, elect a subject minor in bioengineering. Such a program shall\nconsist of 45 units of upper division course work in bioengineering, with each\ncourse passed with a grade of C or better. Courses used to satisfy course\nrequirements in the student\u2019s major option may not be used to satisfy the\nminor requirements. Approval of each program must be obtained from the\nbioengineering graduate option representative.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program\n\nGraduate students in biology come with very diverse undergraduate\npreparation\u2014majors in physics, chemistry, mathematics, or psychology, as well\nas in biology and its various branches. The aims of the graduate program are\nto provide, for each student, individual depth of experience and competence in\na particular chosen major specialty; perception of the nature and logic of\nbiology as a whole; sufficient strength in basic science to allow continued\nself-education after formal training has been completed and thus to keep in\nthe forefront of changing fields; and the motivation to serve their field\nproductively through a long career.\n\nIn accordance with these aims, the graduate study program in biology includes\nthe following parts: (a) the major program, which is to provide the student\nwith early and intense original research experience in a self-selected subject\nof biology, supplemented with advanced course work and independent study in\nthis subject; and (b) a program of course work designed to provide well-\nrounded and integrated training in biology and the appropriate basic sciences,\nwhich is adjusted to special interests and needs. An individual program will\nbe recommended to each student in a meeting with the student\u2019s advisory\ncommittee (see below). The Division of Biology and Biological Engineering does\nnot encourage applications from students who have pursued undergraduate study\nin biology at the Institute, because the broader perspective to be gained from\ngraduate study in a different setting is considered to be essential for the\nfull development of each student\u2019s potential. Exceptions to this policy may be\nconsidered by the faculty of the division if there are circumstances that\nindicate that it would be in the best interests of a student to pursue\ngraduate study at the Institute.\n\n##  Bi Admission\n\nApplicants are expected to meet the following minimal requirements:\nmathematics through calculus, general physics, organic chemistry, physical\nchemistry (or the equivalent), and elementary biology. Students with deficient\npreparation in one or more of these categories may be admitted but required to\nremedy their deficiencies in the first years of graduate training, with no\ngraduate credit being granted for such remedial study.\n\n##  Bi Master\u2019s Degree\n\nThe Biology option does not admit students for work toward the M.S. degree. In\nspecial circumstances the M.S. degree may be awarded, provided Institute\nrequirements are met. In general, the degree is not conferred until the end of\nthe second year of residence. The degree does not designate any of the\ndisciplines of the division, but is an M.S. in Biology. The 135 units required\nby the Institute must include Bi 252 and any two courses from the series Bi\n250 abcd.\n\n##  Bi Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\n###  Major Subjects of Specialization\n\nA student may pursue major work leading to the doctoral degree in any of the\nfollowing subjects: biophysics, cellular biology, developmental biology,\ngenetics, immunology, microbiology, molecular biology and biochemistry, and\nsystems biology. At graduation, a student may choose whether the degree is to\nbe awarded in biology or in the selected major subject. Students who choose to\nwork in neurobiology may also qualify for a Ph.D. in Biology but are\nencouraged to enroll in the Neurobiology option.\n\n###  Initial Advisory Meeting\n\nAt the start of the first year of study, incoming students meet with the\noption representative or faculty member(s) specified by the option\nrepresentative. The purpose of this meeting is to assist the student in\norganizing laboratory rotations, and to discuss what additional course work is\ndesirable in light of the student\u2019s past record.\n\n###  Rotations\n\nThe major initial responsibility of each student is to explore the various\nresearch possibilities available at Caltech before settling into a laboratory\nfor their thesis research. Students are free to rotate in any laboratory at\nCaltech, not just those in the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering.\nFirst-year students should carry out a minimum of two laboratory rotations;\nthree rotations are recommended. It is generally expected that rotations will\nlast a full academic quarter; however, exceptions can be granted with the\nadvance permission of the professor. Choice of laboratory should be made by\nthe end of June of the first year except in extraordinary circumstances. Any\nexception should be discussed with the option representative.\n\n###  Formal Classes\n\nDuring the first year of graduate studies, students are required to take\nResponsible Conduct of Research (Bi 252) and at least two courses from the\nseries Bi 250 abcd that covers the breadth of fields represented in biology at\nCaltech. During each year that they are matriculated in the Ph.D. program,\nstudents are required to take Bi 251 abc (Biolunch). Students will be required\nto present their thesis research in Biolunch during their second and fourth\nyears of study. In addition to these fixed requirements, during their time at\nCaltech students must take three additional 100-series or 200-series courses\n(9 or more units each; grade of B or higher in each course), at least one of\nwhich must focus on mathematical or statistical methods relevant to biology.\n\n###  Teaching\n\nAll students are required to serve as teaching assistants for two quarters\nwhile they are in residence. Teaching is optional first year.\n\n###  Admission to Candidacy\n\nDuring winter quarter of the second year, a student is to set up a thesis\nproposal examining committee and prepare a proposal focused on the research\nproject that they expect to pursue for their thesis research. The proposal is\ndefended by the student in an oral presentation in front of the thesis\nproposal examining committee by the end of June. (Although it is anticipated\nthat this exam will be completed by June of the second year, it can be delayed\nuntil August of the third year if the option representative agrees.) The\nexamining committee comprises four faculty members, at least three of whom\nshould hold full or joint professorial appointments in the Division of Biology\nand Biological Engineering. One of the members of the committee is appointed\nas chair. The chair of the thesis examining committee must be a Caltech\nfaculty member other than the student\u2019s adviser. The adviser can, but need not\nbe, a member of the examining committee. The members of the thesis proposal\nexamining committee must certify passage of this exam. In the event that there\nis inadequate evidence of the capacity to do research, the student may be\nallowed to petition to re-take the oral exam at a later time. However, in\ncases where the committee deems it unlikely that the student will be able to\npass a subsequent attempt, the student may be advised to leave the program. In\nany event, a student cannot remain in the program beyond August of the third\nyear without having successfully completed the requirements for admission to\ncandidacy, except in extraordinary circumstances and with the approval of the\noption representative and the dean of graduate studies.\n\n###  Thesis Advisory Committee Meetings\n\nOnce a student has been formally admitted to candidacy, they are to pick a\nThesis Advisory Committee (TAC). This committee is often the same as the\nthesis proposal exam committee, but that need not be the case. The thesis\nadviser must be a member of the TAC. The TAC typically has four members. At\nleast three must be professorial faculty who hold a full or joint appointment\nin the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering. It is expected that\nstudents who have been admitted to candidacy will meet with the TAC once a\nyear for the remainder of their time at Caltech. Students who fail to meet\nwith their TAC in any one year may be deemed to not be maintaining\nsatisfactory progress toward the Ph.D. degree and will be prevented from\nregistering for the subsequent academic year.\n\n###  Maintaining Satisfactory Progress\n\nIt is the policy of the Biology option that a graduate student who is making\nsatisfactory progress toward a Ph.D. degree can expect to continue as a\nregistered student with full financial support. To be deemed as making\nsatisfactory progress, a student is expected to fulfill the expectations\nlisted below. In the event that satisfactory progress is not being made, a\nstudent can petition to receive the M.S. degree, for which they must have\nsuccessfully completed one full year of graduate study. Requirements for\nsatisfactory progress include:  \n\n  * Completion of the first-year course requirements during the first year.\n  * Joining a laboratory in which a student will perform thesis research before the end of the first year in residence.\n  * Passing the qualifying examination and completing admission to candidacy before the start of the fourth year in residence.\n  * Holding a Thesis Advisory Committee meeting in each subsequent year of studies, and having the thesis committee verify that satisfactory progress is being made.\n  * Serving as a teaching assistant for one quarter of each academic year spent in residence through third year.\n  * Completing Ph.D. studies by the end of the sixth year.\n\nIn the event that the student, option representative, and adviser are in\nagreement, it is possible to make exceptions to the above guidelines and\nremain in good standing. Extension of thesis work beyond twenty-four terms\nrequires that the student petition the dean of graduate studies for permission\nto register. Extensions beyond the seventh year will be allowed only in\nunusual circumstances. Once a student has passed admission to candidacy, the\nresponsibility for assessing satisfactory progress lies largely with the\nstudent\u2019s Thesis Advisory Committee. If a majority of the committee deems that\na student is not making satisfactory progress, the student is at risk of being\nremoved from the program at any time at the discretion of the option\nrepresentative.\n\n###  Examination Committee\n\nRequirements for the Ph.D. thesis and examination are determined by the Ph.D.\nexamination committee that is appointed by the dean of graduate studies for\neach degree candidate. This committee is usually the same as the Thesis\nAdvisory Committee, but this need not be the case. The composition of the\ncommittee must be approved by the option representative. The committee usually\nhas four members. At least three must be professorial faculty who hold a full\nor joint appointment in the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering.\n\n###  Thesis and Final Examination\n\nThe thesis and associated publications are expected to demonstrate that the\nstudent has learned how to conceive, plan, and execute experimental and/or\ntheoretical work that reveals new biological information. In addition, it must\nreveal a deep, broad, and rigorous understanding of the area of research to\nwhich the thesis is relevant.\n\nTwo weeks after copies of the thesis are provided to the examining committee,\ndivision chair, and option representative, the candidate collects the copies\nand comments for correction. At this time, the date for the final examination\nis set at the discretion of the thesis advisor and the division chair. The\nfinal oral examination covers principally the work of the thesis, and\naccording to Institute regulations must be held at least two weeks before the\ndegree is conferred. A digital copy of the thesis is required for the\nInstitute Library, including both PDF and original source files. Both should\nbe deposited into CaltechTHESIS.\n\n###  Caltech-Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine MD/PhD Program\n\nThere is a dual-degree program between Caltech and the Kaiser Permanente\nBernard J. Tyson School of Medicine (KPSOM) for the granting of the M.D./Ph.D.\ndegree. Students receive their medical training at KPSOM, and perform their\nPh.D. work with any member of the Caltech faculty.\n\nAdmission to this dual-degree program is made through the KPSOM M.D./Ph.D.\nprocess. The M.D. degree is awarded by KPSOM, and the Ph.D. is awarded by\nCaltech.\n\nThe dual-degree program is directed by Dr. Jose M. Barral at KPSOM and\nProfessor Paul Sternberg at Caltech. For more information, see\n[medschool.kp.org/education/curriculum#dual-\ndegrees](https://medschool.kp.org/admissions/md-phd-program).\n\n###  Caltech-UCLA Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP)\n\nA joint program between Caltech and the UCLA Medical School has been\nestablished for the granting of the M.D./Ph.D. degree. Students do their\npreclinical and clinical work at UCLA, and their Ph.D. work with any member of\nthe Caltech faculty, including the biology, chemistry, and engineering and\napplied science divisions.\n\nAdmission to this joint program is made through the usual UCLA MSTP process,\nchecking a box indicating interest in the Caltech option. Students will be\naccepted into the joint program, funds permitting. The M.D. degree would be\nfrom UCLA and the Ph.D. would be awarded by Caltech.\n\nThe current Directors of the UCLA MSTP are Dr. Olujimi Ajijola and Dr. David\nDawson, and Caltech Professor Mitch Guttman is the Associate Director. For\nmore information, see\n[mstp.healthsciences.ucla.edu](https://mstp.healthsciences.ucla.edu/application-\nprocedure/).\n\n###  Caltech-USC MD/PhD Program\n\nA joint program between Caltech and the USC (Keck) Medical School has been\nestablished for the granting of the M.D./Ph.D. degree. Students do their\npreclinical and clinical work at USC, and their Ph.D. work with any member of\nthe Caltech faculty.\n\nAdmission to this joint program is made through the usual USC process,\nchecking a box indicating interest in the Caltech option. Students will be\naccepted into the joint program, funds permitting. The M.D. degree would be\nfrom USC and the Ph.D. would be awarded by Caltech.\n\nThe current Director of the USC M.D./Ph.D. program is Dr. Brian Lee. The\nDirector for Caltech is Professor Paul Sternberg. For more information, see\n[keck.usc.edu/md-phd-program.](https://keck.usc.edu/md-phd-\nprogram/admissions/)\n\n##  Bi Subject Minor\n\nA student majoring in any non-biology option of the Institute may, with the\napproval of the Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, elect a\nsubject minor in any of the subjects listed above under major subjects of\nspecialization. Requirements for such a minor are determined by the faculty\ncommittee designated for each subject. A minor program in Biology is also\navailable to students of other divisions. Such a program shall consist of 45\nunits of upper division course work in the Division of Biology and Biological\nEngineering, with each course passed with a grade of C or better. Approval of\neach program must be obtained from the Biology graduate option representative.\nA student majoring in another division who elects a subject minor in Biology\nmay, if desired, arrange to have the minor designated as Biology, rather than\nwith the name of the specific minor subject.\n\n"

The courses during the second term include one each in advanced Transport (ChE 151 a) and Statistical Thermodynamics (ChE 164) and a third course as above. The third course taken during the first and second terms must be at least 9 units and graded. The entire first year of study will also be discussed.\n  * _Course Requirements:_ During the first year, Ph.D. students are required to take the five core courses: ChE 151ab, ChE 152, ChE 164, ChE 165, plus three units of the ChE Seminar Course (ChE 290abc) and one additional ChE course from the following list: ChE 112, 113, 115, Ch/ChE 140ab, 147, 148, 155, ESE/ChE 158, 159, BE/ChE 163, 174, 188. All units must be taken for grades, except for courses offered only on a pass/fail basis, and a minimum grade of B- is required in each one. There is also a minimum GPA requirement of 2.5 each term of all courses taken. Failure to meet the minimum GPA requirement in any term, or failure to meet the B- grade requirement for more than one core course, is cause for termination. Exceptions will be considered if petitioned by the research adviser. The petition should be filed soon after completion of the final ChE core class. The petition will be evaluated by the ChE faculty and it must include a plan to correct the deficiency.\n  * _Subject Minor or External Coursework:_ Each student is required to complete either a subject minor or a general program of courses outside chemical engineering. The general program of courses consists of at least 54 units. A maximum of 27 units from the following list of doubly-listed courses can be used by graduate students as part of the 54-unit requirement: ESE/ChE 158; Ch/ChE 140, 147, ChE/Ch 148, 155, ESE/Ge/Ch 171. A course in the ACM 100ab sequence will be credited 9 units instead of the nominal 12 units as listed in the catalog. Courses offered by options in the Division of Humanities and Social Sciences are explicitly excluded from the general program. The requirements for a subject minor in other options may be found in the current _Caltech Catalog_. The general program of courses must be submitted and approved by the ChE option representative during the first year residence. All courses chosen must be at the graduate level (most 100- or 200- level courses) and should constitute an integrated program of study rather than a randomly chosen collection of courses outside chemical engineering. All units must be taken for grades, except for courses offered only on a pass/fail basis. A grade of C or better is required in any of these courses to remain qualified for the Ph.D. program.\n\n###  2\\. Research Adviser\n\nThe choice of a research adviser is perhaps the most important decision a\ngraduate student makes during the first year of graduate study. This decision\nmust be made before the end of the second term of the first year, and so it is\nreasonable to devote significant thought and effort to this task before then.\n\nAt the beginning of the fall quarter, all faculty will present overviews of\ntheir research program. All first-year students must attend all sessions.\nFollowing these presentations, students are expected to meet individually with\nat least two faculty members to discuss proposed research projects and the\npossibility of doing a rotation in that faculty member\u2019s group during the\nfirst or second terms. All students must formally join a group by the end of\nthe second term.\n\n###  3\\. Rotations\n\nRotations serve to acquaint the student with a group\u2019s research area and\nstyle. Two quarter-long rotations are required. During a rotation, the student\nmust participate in research activities in the chosen group for at least nine\nhours per week under the tutelage of a faculty or senior group member. At the\nend of a rotation, the student must produce a research report and give a group\npresentation. The report, signed by the rotation adviser, is forward to the\nChE option representative. If the student and the faculty member decide that\nthe \u201cmatch\u201d of research interests and personalities is good, the student may\nremain the same group for a second rotation, effectively joining the group.\nOtherwise, the student should proceed to do a second rotation in another group\nwith the same requirements as above.\n\n###  4\\. Candidacy Exam\n\nAll students are required to pass the candidacy examination, ideally before\nthe end of the second term of the second year. This oral exam is administered\nby a Candidacy Committee and consists of two parts:\n\n  * A presentation by the student based on the contents of a research progress report.\n  * Background questions part broadly related to the research problem presented.\n\nThe research progress report must be submitted to the Candidacy Committee\nmembers and the ChE option representative at least three weeks before the oral\nexam date. The report should expound on the research pursued by the student\nand is expected to exhibit originality and a professional quality of\nexposition. It should outline the research problem, the proposed approach, the\nexpected contributions in the general problem area, preliminary results, and\nthe progress of the student at the time of writing. It should also provide\nclear evidence of the student\u2019s understanding of the research topic, the\nunderlying science and technology related to that research, and the student\u2019s\nmastering of the relevant techniques and methodology necessary to pursue the\nproposed research.\n\nThe Candidacy Committee consists of four members, with a minimum of two\nchemical engineering professional faculty. The chair of the committee is a\nchemical engineering professional faculty member distinct from the adviser.\nEmeritus faculty, research faculty, JPL staff and external scholars may serve\non the committee, with approval of the option representative and the dean of\ngraduate studies in advance of the examination. Any changes to your thesis\nexamination committee or examination after approval must be submitted to your\noption manager. The choice of the oral exam committee will be made by the\nstudent and their research adviser and must be approved by the ChE option\nrepresentative. It is the responsibility of the student to obtain approval\nfrom each proposed committee member for the date and time of the oral exam.\nThe list of the recommended committee members must be submitted to the option\nrepresentative for approval at least three weeks before the oral exam date.\n\nThe second component of the oral exam consists of chemical engineering\nbackground questions relating broadly to the student\u2019s research topic. The\nchairperson of the Candidacy Committee shall be responsible for ensuring that\nthe questions are at an appropriate level, consistent with that of\nundergraduates at Caltech. For example, if the Ph.D. focus is on heterogeneous\ncatalysis, the student must be able to answer questions on basics such as:\nsurface reaction mechanisms, diffusion/reaction in porous media, and multi-\ncomponent gas-phase transport, etc. Similar considerations apply to Ph.D.\nprojects related to fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, biology, physics,\nchemistry, etc. The advanced courses taken during the first year should help\nyou prepare well for this part of the exam. Serious gaps in the understanding\nof classical chemical engineering concepts, approaches, and methodologies\napplicable to your research may lead to failing the exam even if research\nprogress is deemed adequate. Furthermore, for interdisciplinary projects going\nbeyond classical chemical engineering, the student will be expected to\ndemonstrate good understanding of the fundamentals in other areas directly\nrelevant to their project.\n\nThe candidacy exam may have three outcomes: Pass, Deferred Decision, or Fail.\nPassing the candidacy exam, along with successful completion of all coursework\nadmits the student to candidacy for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy.\nFailing the candidacy exam terminates the student\u2019s Ph.D. program at Caltech.\nWhen course requirements are met, the student may be awarded an M.S. degree at\nthe recommendation of the Candidacy Committee. In the case of a Deferred\nDecision, the committee chair will put in writing what is required and the\ntime frame to meet those requirements. Under no circumstances is this time to\nexceed one term. In any case, a Pass or Fail decision must be reached at the\nlatest by September 1 of the second year in residence. This is a hard deadline\nfor both the student and the committee. If there is no communication to the\nChE option representative about this decision, a Fail decision will be entered\nautomatically.\n\n###  5\\. Thesis Review Committee\n\nAfter the student passes the candidacy exam, the Candidacy Committee becomes\nthe \u201cde-facto\u201d Thesis Review Committee, which will be responsible for\nreviewing the student\u2019s progress. The committee must be convened (as a group)\nduring the third year of residency, and every year thereafter to review\nprogress, suggest improvements in research, or resolve any issues that could\npotentially delay graduation beyond the fifth year of residency. It is the\nresponsibility of the student to organize the annual meetings of the Thesis\nReview Committee during each academic year. Students will be unable to\nregister for Fall term if they have not met with their Thesis Review Committee\nduring the current academic year. Registration beyond the fourth year is\nsubject to written approval by the Thesis Review Committee and the ChE option\nrepresentative. To expedite the review for registration beyond the fourth\nyear, the student should submit a two- or three-page concise outline of\nprogress and of proposed future research to each member of their committee\nbefore the annual review meeting.\n\n###  6\\. Final Thesis and Oral Defense\n\nAs a final step in the Ph.D. program, the student is required to submit a\nsatisfactory thesis, present a ChE seminar (open to the general public), and\npass a final oral examination.\n\n_Procedures for Seminar, Exam, and Committee Selection:_ At least three weeks\nprior to the exam date, the ChE option manager must be given the title of the\nseminar, date, time and location. Both the seminar and exam should be\nscheduled on the same day, with the exam immediately following the seminar.\nThe committee members will be determined by the student and their research\nadviser, and must be approved by the ChE option representative and the dean of\ngraduate studies. The examining committee consists of four members, with a\nminimum of two chemical engineering professorial faculty. The chair of the\ncommittee is a chemical engineering professorial faculty member distinct from\nthe adviser. Emeritus faculty, research faculty, JPL staff and external\nscholars may serve on the committee, with approval of the option\nrepresentative and the dean of graduate studies in advance of the examination.\nAny changes to your thesis examination committee or examination after approval\nmust be submitted to your option manager.\n\n###  7\\. Graduate Teaching Assignment (GTA) Duties\n\nAll Ph.D. students are required to perform a minimum of 24 term-hours of GTA\nduties within the ChE Department during their studies. The GTA duties will\nnormally be assigned after the first year in residence. Most students find the\nteaching assistantship a valuable experience for their future careers.\nTeaching assistantships outside ChE are permitted but the hours do not count\ntoward the 24-hour TA requirement.\n\n##  Additional Information\n\nAdditional information about graduate study requirements and procedures is\nprovided in the chemical engineering graduate studies guide, distributed\nannually to first-year chemical engineering graduate students.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program\n\nThe Caltech chemistry option offers a program of graduate study leading to the\nPh.D. degree, with the goal of preparing students for a lifetime of\nindependent research and scientific leadership in the chemical sciences,\nthrough careers in academia, industry, or government. Modern chemistry strives\nto achieve a molecular-level understanding of the natural world and thus forms\nthe basis of modern science, including biology, medicine, materials,\nnanotechnology, energy and environmental sustainability. The program of study\nis flexible and highly interdisciplinary, encompassing organic chemistry,\ninorganic chemistry, chemical biology, biochemistry and biophysics, chemical\nphysics, and theoretical chemistry.\n\nThe graduate program in chemistry emphasizes research. This emphasis reflects\nthe Institute\u2019s traditional leadership in chemical research and the conviction\nthat participation in original research is the best way to awaken, develop,\nand give direction to creativity, a philosophy that has permeated the Division\nof Chemistry and Chemical Engineering since its founding.\n\nThe program is designed to encourage students to begin their research early in\ntheir first year. Students can elect to do research that crosses the\nboundaries of traditionally separate areas of chemistry, for in this\nrelatively compact division, they are encouraged to go where their scientific\ncuriosity drives them. A thesis that involves more than one adviser is not\nuncommon, and interdisciplinary programs with biology, physics, geology,\nchemical engineering, and environmental science and engineering science are\nopen and encouraged.\n\nTo accommodate the needs of interdisciplinary research programs, the program\nis divided into two tracks: Chemistry; and Chemical Biology & Molecular\nBioscience (CB&MB). The two tracks differ in the timing of rotations, choosing\nresearch advisor(s), and teaching, but otherwise have the same requirements\nfor completion of the Ph.D. degree.\n\nAn extensive program of seminars will enable students to discover and discuss\nnotable work in chemical physics, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry and\nelectrochemistry, organometallic chemistry, chemical biology, and biochemistry\nand molecular biophysics. Graduate students are also encouraged to attend\nseminars in other divisions.\n\n##  Ch Learning Outcomes\n\nStudents upon whom are conferred the Ph.D. degree have provided evidence of\nindependent scholarship and scientific creativity through the performance of\noriginal research, which is described in their doctoral thesis and defended\norally. Students must also demonstrate an ability to conceive new research\ndirections by preparing and defending a set of written research propositions.\n\n##  Ch Course Program\n\nA student is required to complete at least five courses, each being nine units\nor more, in science or engineering. CB&MB students are expected to take Ch/Bi\n110a or demonstrate completion of an equivalent course in college. At least\none course must be in a field substantially outside the research area of the\nstudent. Courses may be either inside or outside the chemistry option, must be\nnumbered 100 or greater, and must be taken on a letter-grade basis with a\ngrade of B or above. The student should discuss, with their adviser, which\ncourses best serve their individual needs. The program of courses must be\napproved by the research adviser and by the Chemistry Graduate Study\nCommittee.\n\n##  Ch Master\u2019s Degree\n\nStudents are not ordinarily admitted to graduate work leading to an M.S.\ndegree. Under special circumstances, and with prior approval of the Graduate\nStudy Committee, a master\u2019s degree can be obtained. All master\u2019s programs for\nthe degree in chemistry must include at least 45 units of chemical research\nand must satisfy the Course Program described above. The remaining electives\nmay be satisfied by advanced work in any area of mathematics, science or\nengineering, or by chemical research. A satisfactory thesis describing this\nresearch, including a one-page digest or summary of the main results obtained,\nmust be submitted to the divisional graduate studies office at least 10 days\nbefore the degree is to be conferred. In addition, the fulfillment of the\nthesis requirement must be signed off by a designated faculty member on the\nM.S. candidacy form and a final copy of the thesis submitted to the Graduate\nOffice no later than two weeks before the degree is to be conferred. The\ncopies of the thesis should be prepared according to the directions formulated\nby the dean of graduate studies and should be accompanied by a statement of\napproval of the thesis, signed by the adviser directing the research and by\nthe chair of the Chemistry Graduate Study Committee.\n\n##  Ch Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\n###  Selecting a Research Project\n\nSoon after a new graduate student arrives at Caltech, they attend a series of\norientation seminars that introduce students to the active research interests\nof the faculty. Students are strongly encouraged to meet with faculty whose\nfields attract them, to attend group meetings, and to discuss in detail\npotential research projects.\n\nStudents are required to complete a minimum of two rotations in different\nresearch groups of their choice before committing to an advisor-advisee\nrelationship (exceptions to rotate in the same group twice are dissuaded but\nmay be approved on rare occasions by submitting a petition to the division).\nStudents in the Chemistry track generally participate in two 4-week rotations.\nThe opening date for Chemistry track students to join a research group is\nDecember 1st. CB&MB students must participate in at least two 10-week\nrotations and may join a group at the end of the winter term. Both tracks\npermit additional rotations. Through these rotations, students eventually\nsettle upon the outlines of a research problem that interest them and select a\nspecific research advisor (or set of co-advisers).\n\n###  Candidacy\n\nTo be recommended for candidacy for the doctor\u2019s degree in chemistry, a\nstudent must demonstrate un understanding and knowledge of the fundamentals of\nchemistry and give satisfactory evidence of proficiency at a high level in the\nprimary field of interest, as approved by the division. This is accomplished\nby an oral candidacy examination, which must be held during or before the\nsixth term of graduate residence (excluding summer terms). The candidacy\ncommittee shall consist of the thesis adviser(s) and two additional faculty\nmembers; at least two of the three members must be chemistry faculty. The\ncommittee should be considered as a resource for the student for the remainder\nof their studies. At the candidacy examination, a student is asked to\ndemonstrate scientific and professional competence and promise by discussing a\nresearch report and propositions as described below.\n\nThe research report should describe progress and accomplishments to date and\nplans for future research. Two original research propositions, or brief\nscientific theses, must accompany the report, and at least one must be well\nremoved from the student\u2019s field of research. These propositions should\nreflect familiarity with the literature, originality, and ability to pose and\nanalyze suitable scientific research problems. The research report and\npropositions must be in the hands of the examining committee as either an\nelectronic pdf file or a bound, hard-copy document one week before the\nexamination.\n\nThe result of the candidacy examination may be either (a) pass, (b) fail, or\n(c) conditional. Conditional status is granted when the committee decides that\ndeficiencies in a student\u2019s research report, propositions, or overall progress\ncan be remedied in a specific and relatively brief period of time. In order to\nchange conditional to pass status, the student must correct the indicated\ndeficiencies or in some cases schedule a new examination the following term.\nThe student must be admitted to candidacy at least three terms before the\nfinal oral examination (i.e., thesis defense). A student cannot continue\ngraduate work in chemistry (nor can financial assistance be continued) past\nthe end of the sixth term of residence (e.g., spring term of the G2 year)\nwithout being admitted to candidacy, except by petitioning the division for\nspecial permission. This permission, to be requested by a petition submitted\nto the Graduate Study Committee stating a proposed timetable for correction of\ndeficiencies, must be submitted before registration for each subsequent term\n(including the summer following the sixth term of residence) until admission\nto candidacy is achieved.\n\n###  Graduate Teaching Assignment Duties\n\nAll Ph.D. students are required to perform a minimum of one 9 term-hour GTA\nwithin the chemistry option before the completion of the fourth year of study.\nIn practice, students are expected to perform three GTAs during the G1 and G2\nyears. Chemistry track students generally serve as TAs during the fall,\nwinter, and spring terms of the G1 year, while CM&MB students generally serve\nas TAs during the spring term of the G1 year and during the fall and winter\nterms of the G2 year. Additionally, students may serve as GTAs in subsequent\nyears of study, with their advisor's approval. Most students find the teaching\nassistantship a valuable experience for their future careers.\n\n###  Language Requirement\n\nThere is no formal foreign language requirement for the Ph.D. in chemistry.\nHowever, the division believes strongly in the professional importance to\nchemists of knowledge of foreign languages and encourages their study prior to\ngraduate work or while in graduate school.\n\n###  Ph.D. Thesis Committee\n\nFollowing admission to candidacy, the student will form their Ph.D. committee\nin consultation with their advisor. This committee will comprise at least four\nfaculty members and will generally consist of the original candidacy committee\nplus an additional member of the faculty; at least three of the members must\nbe from the CCE Option.\n\n###  Annual Meetings requirement\n\nThe student must meet with their committee annually, beginning in the third\nyear. Students who do not meet this requirement will not be able to register\nfor future terms except by submitting a petition to the division. At these\ninformal meetings, the student will update the committee on the status of\ntheir research.\n\nTypically, a student will provide an updated CV, a short research summary (2-3\npages), and a brief outline of plans for the coming year. Upon successful\ncompletion of each annual meeting, students will enter their meeting data in\nREGIS.\n\nIf the student has not progressed sufficiently, completion of the Ph.D. may be\nconsidered inappropriate.\n\n###  Fourth Year Progress Meeting\n\nBefore the 13th academic term of graduate residence (excluding summer terms,\ni.e., end of the G4 year), the student will be expected to demonstrate\nsatisfactory progress in the course of thesis research. To this end, an\ninformal meeting with the Ph.D. thesis committee will be held. Typically, a\nstudent provides an updated CV, a short research summary (2-3 pages), a thesis\noutline with %-completed for each chapter, and a timeline for completion of\nthe degree. At the meeting, the student will likely present an oral summary of\nresearch completed to date as well as an outline of future research plans.\nFollowing the discussion, an appropriate timetable for completion of the\ndegree requirements will be discussed and agreed upon. It is also common to\ndiscuss plans for post-Caltech at the meeting.\n\n###  Length of Graduate Residence\n\nAny graduate student who anticipates a need to register for a 24th term must\nhold a meeting of their thesis committee and present the institute-required\npetition for permission to register that includes a plan of action for the\nperiod of the requested registration and a specific date for the completion of\nthe degree requirements. This petition must be approved by the Thesis\nCommittee, by the chair of the Chemistry Graduate Study Committee and, in\ncases where financial support is an issue, by the executive officer or\ndivision chair, before it is forwarded to the dean of graduate studies.\nFinancial support of graduate students who are required to petition to\nregister will not normally be provided through teaching assistantships.\nFailure to complete the degree requirements by the date specified in the\npetition would require the entire approval process to be repeated. This\nprocess must be repeated for every subsequent year.\n\n###  Thesis and Final Examination\n\nThe final examinations consist of two parts: (i) a propositions exam; and (ii)\na Ph.D. thesis defense.\n\nFor the propositions exam, three original research propositions are required.\nNo more than one of these may be a carryover from the candidacy examination,\nand at least one must be well removed from the field of research. Each\nproposition must be presented in writing with adequate documentation. The\npropositions should display originality, breadth of interest, and soundness of\ntraining; a student will be judged on the selection and formulation of the\npropositions as well as on the defense of them. Formulating a set of\npropositions should begin early in the course of graduate study.\n\nTo emphasize the importance of these propositions, there will be a separate\nexamination on the three propositions by the Ph.D. thesis committee. This\nexamination on the propositions is normally taken after the thesis research\nprogress meeting, but not less than 10 weeks in advance of the final doctoral\nexamination. A copy of the propositions, along with suitable abstracts, must\nbe submitted to the examining committee not less than two weeks before the\npropositions examination. These propositions must be acceptable to the\ncommittee before the final doctoral examination can be scheduled.\n\nFor the Ph.D. thesis defense, a copy of the thesis must be submitted to each\nmember of the thesis committee not less than two weeks before the final\ndoctoral examination. A copy of the thesis should also be submitted to the\nInstitute Graduate Office for proofreading no less than two weeks prior to the\nfinal doctoral examination.\n\nIn order to complete the Ph.D. degree requirements, the student must not only\npass the oral thesis defense but also upload a final, approved version of the\nthesis to the CaltechTHESIS.\n\n##  Ch Subject Minor\n\nGraduate students in other options taking chemistry as a subject minor will be\nassigned a faculty adviser in chemistry by the Chemistry Graduate Study\nCommittee. In consultation with this adviser, the student will work out an\nintegrated program of courses, including at least 45 units of formal course\nwork at the 100 level or above. This program must be approved by the Chemistry\nGraduate Study Committee, and a grade point average of 3.0 in the approved\nprogram will be required.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program\n\nCivil Engineering (CE) research and study are offered through the Department\nof Mechanical and Civil Engineering (MCE). The degrees of Doctor of Philosophy\n(Ph.D.) and Master of Science (M.S.) are offered. In general, students who\nintend to work full-time toward the Ph.D. degree as a final degree objective\nare admitted to the Civil Engineering Graduate Program. The M.S. degree is\ntypically only awarded to students who pursue the Ph.D. degree in civil\nengineering at Caltech and who do not already have an M.S. degree in civil\nengineering.\n\nThe aim of the graduate program in civil engineering at Caltech is to prepare\nstudents for research and professional practice in an era of rapidly advancing\ninterdisciplinary technology. The program combines individual depth of\nexperience and competence in a particular chosen major specialty, with a\nstrong background in the basic and engineering sciences. It strives to develop\nprofessional independence, creativity, leadership, and the capacity for\ncontinuing professional and intellectual growth.\n\n##  CE Preparation for the Graduate Program\n\nEntering graduate students are expected to have a thorough background in\nundergraduate mathematics, physics, and engineering. While a strong\nundergraduate program in civil engineering should provide a suitable\npreparation, students who have not specialized in civil engineering as\nundergraduates may also be admitted for graduate study. For example, an\noutstanding four-year undergraduate program in mathematics and sciences may\nprovide a suitable background as well. The qualifications of each applicant\nwill be considered individually, and, after being enrolled, the student will\narrange their program in consultation with a member of the faculty.\n\n##  CE Master\u2019s Degree\n\nThe degree of Master of Science in civil engineering is only awarded to\nstudents who do not already have an M.S. degree in civil engineering. The\ndegree will be awarded upon request by students who have fulfilled the\nrequirements. Only in exceptional cases is there admission to the M.S. program\nas the final degree objective.\n\nA minimum of 138 units of courses numbered 100 or above, which meet the\nrequired master\u2019s program listed below, must be passed with a grade of at\nleast C for completion of the master\u2019s degree in civil engineering. All units\nmust be taken for grades, except for courses offered only on a pass/fail\nbasis. The M.S. degree in civil engineering is typically completed within the\nfirst two years of residency at Caltech.\n\nEach student\u2019s program must be approved by the adviser and option\nrepresentative in mechanical and civil engineering before registering for the\ncourse.\n\n###  Required Master\u2019s Program\n\n  1. Graduate civil engineering core (45 units). These units should provide a solid base for the student\u2019s engineering interest. The courses should be selected from the Core CE subjects listed under the of the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Description and Requirements section.\n  2. Mathematics, engineering, and research electives, except seminar courses (63 units). Research can be included up to a maximum of 27 units.\n  3. Free electives (27 units). Any course with a number of 100 or greater may be selected, except that research units and seminar courses can not be included.\n  4. Graduate Engineering Seminar, AM/CE/ME 150 abc (3 units).\n\n##  CE Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\nThe Ph.D. degree in civil engineering is focused on research. Study and\nresearch programs for the Ph.D. degree are individually planned to fit the\ninterests and background of the student. A comprehensive research project\nresulting in an original contribution to the field, which is documented by a\nthesis, is required. Institute requirements for the Ph.D. degree are described\nin the section on degree requirements. A minimum of three academic years in\nresidence as a graduate student are required by the Institute, and two or more\nadditional years are usually needed for preparation of the thesis.\n\n###  Advising and Thesis Supervision\n\nAn interim adviser is appointed for each student upon admission to a graduate\ndegree in civil engineering. The interim adviser will serve as the primary\nmentor until the student finds a research adviser. It is the responsibility of\nthe student to find an academic and research adviser within three terms of\ngraduate residence at Caltech. In consultation with the adviser, the student\nmust form a Ph.D. Thesis Advisory Committee within four terms of graduate\nresidence at Caltech. This committee shall consist of at least three members\nof the Caltech professorial faculty, with at least two members from the\nfaculty in mechanical and civil engineering. The committee shall meet as\nrequested by the student. Further, the committee shall meet annually to review\nprogress and to approve the registration of the student beyond the fifth year\nof graduate residence at Caltech.\n\nThe adviser and the Thesis Advisory Committee provide the majority of\nmentoring to the student. In addition, the Option Representative and other\nmembers of the faculty are always available to provide advice and mentoring on\nany aspect of research, progress toward the Ph.D., future careers, and other\naspects of graduate school.\n\n###  Admission to Candidacy\n\nTo be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in civil engineering, the\nstudent must, in addition to meeting the general Institute requirements, do\nthe following:\n\n  * Obtain the agreement of a professorial faculty member to serve as the students academic and research adviser before the end of the third term of graduate residence at Caltech. In consultation with the adviser, the student must form a Ph.D. Thesis Advisory Committee before the end of the fourth term. This committee shall consist of at least three members of the Caltech professorial faculty, with at least two members from the faculty in mechanical and civil engineering.\n  * Pass both subject and research components of the oral candidacy examination before the end of the eighth term of graduate academic residence at Caltech. If the student has chosen a subject minor, an examination on the subject of that program may be included at the request of the discipline offering the subject minor.\n  * Complete a minimum of 195 units of courses numbered 101 or above, that fulfill the required Ph.D. program listed below. All units must be taken for grades and passed with a grade of at least a C, except for courses offered only on a pass/fail basis.

        "content": "##  CNS Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program\n\nAn integrated approach to graduate study combining computation and neural\nsystems is organized jointly by the Division of Biology and Biological\nEngineering, the Division of Engineering and Applied Science, and the Division\nof the Humanities and Social Sciences. This curriculum is designed to promote\na broad knowledge of aspects of molecular, cellular, and systems biology,\ncognitive neuroscience, computational biology and computational neuroscience,\ninformation and learning theory, emergent or collective systems, and computer\nscience and electrical engineering in conjunction with an appropriate depth of\nknowledge in the particular field of the thesis research. For more details,\nsee [cns.caltech.edu](http://www.cns.caltech.edu).\n\n###  Admission\n\nIdeal applicants will have a Bachelor of Science degree or equivalent with a\nstrong quantitative background and some facility with computer programming.\nThey will have shown an interest in understanding the brain and/or in\nautonomous intelligent systems. The GRE tests (general and advanced subject)\nare not required and scores will not be considered for admission.\n\n###  Advisory Committee and TA Requirement\n\nAn advisory committee of three CNS faculty members is constituted for each\nstudent by the CNS admissions committee upon admission to the program. The\nfaculty in whose lab the student is staying first chairs this committee. The\nadvisory committee meets with the student when they arrive, guides and\napproves first-year course choices, and answers questions and offers advice\nabout the program and the way of life in CNS. The CNS faculty are available to\nstudents during the year for formal and/or informal discussions.\n\nIt is expected that each graduate student will serve as a teaching assistant\nin one or two CNS courses during their residency at Caltech as part of the\nPh.D. graduation requirement.\n\n##  CNS Master\u2019s Degree\n\nOnly students who expect to pursue the Ph.D. degree will be admitted to the\noption. The master\u2019s degree may be awarded in exceptional cases. The awarding\nof this degree requires fulfilling the Institute requirements for a master\u2019s\ndegree, satisfying the option breadth requirements (see following section),\nthe completion of a master\u2019s thesis, and receiving from a candidacy\nexamination oral committee a recommendation for awarding the degree.\n\n###  Laboratory Rotations\n\nMandatory rotations through research groups (labs) provide a unique\nopportunity for the student to experience the CNS culture. To broaden the\nstudent\u2019s knowledge and to provide familiarity with different techniques and\nways of thinking or doing research, each student should carry out three\n12-week laboratory rotations (one per term) during the first year, and should\nengage in research. During each rotation, the student is expected to take part\nin the life and routine of the lab by attending lab meetings, participating in\nresearch projects and discussions with members of the lab, and meeting monthly\nwith the faculty of that lab to discuss science.\n\n###  Course Requirements\n\nSix nine-unit courses are required during the first year: CNS/Bi/Ph/CS/NB 187,\neither Bi 9 or equivalent, or NB/Bi/CNS 150, a neurobiology or modeling\ncourse, a math course, and two other CNS, Bi, EE, ACM, or Ph courses (for\nexample, a schedule of CNS/Bi/EE/CS/NB 186, CNS/Bi/Ph/CS/NB 187, NB/Bi/CNS\n150, and CS/CNS/EE 156 satisfies this requirement). CNS students are required\nto take two additional classes: the one-unit survey course CNS 100, and the\nfour-unit course Bi 252. These eight courses must be taken for letter grades.\nStudents are free to take additional classes, and a research adviser may\nrequire that a student take a specific, complementary course as a requirement\nfor joining their lab.\n\n###  Candidacy\n\nFour faculty, including the three faculty in whose labs rotations have been\ndone, should be on the student\u2019s candidacy exam committee. At the end of the\nfirst year, the student is expected to decide on a research group and begin\nwork there. The first summer is thus expected to be spent entirely on research\nin that lab. To be recommended for candidacy you are required to pass two\ntests: the general knowledge exam, and the research and candidacy exam. These\nexams are supervised by the CNS option representative.\n\nThe general knowledge exam satisfies the breadth requirement. A list of about\n100 questions, grouped by category, is available at  \n[www.cns.caltech.edu](http://www.cns.caltech.edu), providing a clear idea of\nthe scope of knowledge that each student is expected to know well. Students\nare encouraged to organize working and discussion groups to prepare for this\nexam; the format and implementation of such a system, however, is left to the\nstudents.\n\nThis is an oral exam with the four faculty (including the heads of the\nstudent\u2019s three rotation labs and one other chosen for \u201cbreadth,\u2019\u2019 of whom one\ncan be from outside Caltech). It should be scheduled by the student (who\ncontacts the committee members) to take place during the last six weeks of the\nthird term of year one. For the exam, the student must answer questions (from\nmore than one category) taken from the list, which is modified each year. (The\nexam can be retaken after three months.)\n\nThe research and candidacy exam satisfies the depth requirement. During year\ntwo, the student is expected to produce a piece of work of a quality\nsufficient to be presented at a professional meeting. (The objective of this\ndescription is to offer a way to calibrate the level of expected research\nachievement and involvement. Professional acceptance of the abstract or paper\nis not a requirement for passing candidacy.) This work is presented in an oral\nexam in spring term of year two, before the same exam committee (if possible)\nthat conducted part one of the exam. The exam focuses exclusively on research\n(accomplished and/or planned). During year two, the student may take other\ncourses, as needed, but is expected to present a high standard (quality,\noriginality) of research at the time of this second part of the candidacy\nexam.\n\n###  Thesis Advisory Committee\n\nOnce admitted to candidacy, the student chooses a Thesis Advisory Committee of\nat least three faculty. This committee serves as a source of advice\nindependent of the Ph.D. adviser throughout the student\u2019s tenure. Each year,\nbefore the end of June, the student delivers a written progress report,\nfollowed by a meeting with the Thesis Advisory Committee.\n\n###  Thesis Examination Committee\n\nThis committee should consist of a minimum of four voting members, three of\nwhom must be Caltech faculty. The final oral examination covers principally\nthe works of the thesis, and according to Institute regulations must be held\nat least three weeks before the degree is to be conferred.\n\n##  CNS Subject Minor\n\nStudents majoring in other fields may take a subject minor in CNS, provided\nthe program is supervised by a CNS adviser, is approved by the CNS option\nrepresentative, and consists of 45 units, including NB/Bi/CNS 150,\nCNS/Bi/Ph/CS/NB 187, Bi 252, and other CNS cross-listed classes. A subject\nminor is not required for the Ph.D. degree in CNS.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program\n\nAward of the Bachelor of Science degree may be followed by graduate study\nleading to the Master of Science degree in electrical engineering, and the\nmore advanced degrees of Electrical Engineer or Doctor of Philosophy. Because\nadmission to graduate studies in electrical engineering at Caltech is\nextremely competitive, the Admissions Committee attempts to select those\napplicants it judges both best qualified and best suited for the graduate\nprogram. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) will not be required for\nadmission to the Ph.D. or M.S. degree programs in Electrical Engineering.\nStudents may choose to submit self-reported scores, but students who choose\nnot to submit scores as part of the application will not be at a disadvantage.\nThe Degree of Doctor of Philosophy offers two tracks: EE only and Medical and\nElectrical Engineering (Med-EE). The Med-EE track is offered jointly by both\ndepartments of Electrical Engineering and Medical Engineering (see MedE\nSection), available to any students to graduate after Fall 2022; the single\ndegree to be shown on the diploma is \u201cPh.D. in Medical and Electrical\nEngineering.\u201d\n\n##  EE Master\u2019s Degree\n\nNormally, the master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering is completed in one\nacademic year. The principal criteria for evaluating applicants for the MSEE\nare the excellence of their preparation for the math- and physics-oriented\nnature of Caltech\u2019s graduate courses, and the judgment of the Admissions\nCommittee on their ability to successfully pursue and benefit from the course\nprogram. The Institute does not normally admit an applicant to the master\u2019s\ndegree in a field in which the applicant already has a master\u2019s degree from\nanother U.S. institution. Financial aid is seldom offered to those who intend\nto complete their graduate work with a master\u2019s degree. A joint B.S./M.S.\ndegree is not available in electrical engineering.\n\n135 units (100 or above) are required as approved by the electrical\nengineering graduate student adviser. No more than 30 units of pass/fail\ngrades may be counted toward this requirement. Units toward this are not\ntransferable from other schools. At least 54 units of EE letter-graded courses\n(courses listed or cross-listed as EE) labeled 100 or above are required. EE\n105 ac and EE 102, Electrical Engineering Seminar, are also required. Students\nare urged to consider including a humanities course in the remaining free\nelectives.\n\nStudents who have been admitted to the M.S.-only program must reapply if they\nare interested in the Ph.D. program.\n\n##  EE Degree of Electrical Engineer\n\nThe engineer\u2019s degree may be awarded in exceptional cases. The awarding of\nthis degree requires fulfilling the Institute requirements for an engineer\u2019s\ndegree and receiving a recommendation for its awarding from the candidacy oral\nexamination committee.\n\n##  EE Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\nAs a rule, applicants who wish to undertake research work leading to a degree\nof Doctor of Philosophy in electrical engineering are admitted initially only\nfor the MSEE. They are, however, evaluated according to additional criteria,\nthe most important of which is the applicant\u2019s interestin and potential for\nresearch in one of the areas described below. The statement of purpose\nrequired as part of the application should clearly address this match.\nConsiderable weight is also given to the opinions expressed in the applicant\u2019s\nletters of recommendation.\n\nDuring the Ph.D. applicant\u2019s master\u2019s degree year, evaluation continues. It is\nbased in part on performance in courses and in part on a qualifying oral\nexamination scheduled early in the second quarter. As the year progresses, the\nelectrical engineering faculty get to know the student, and the student makes\ncontact with the professor in their area of research interest. Upon acceptance\ninto a research group, the student begins research work and defers receiving\nthe master\u2019s degree until formal admission into the Ph.D. program. If the\nAdviser is not an EE faculty member, the student should meet with the EE\nOption Representative and develop an oversight plan to monitor progress.\nBefore the end of their third academic year of graduate study, the student\ntakes the Ph.D. oral candidacy examination.\n\nFinancial aid available to a Ph.D. applicant includes teaching assistantships\nand fellowships. TA duties consist of grading papers or lab instruction but\nnot classroom lecturing. A fellowship may be supplemented by a teaching\nassistantship, and either or both include a full tuition scholarship. Tuition\nscholarships alone are not available.\n\n###  Admission to Candidacy\n\nTo be recommended for candidacy for the EE Ph.D. degree, the applicant must\nsatisfy the following requirements (and pass the Ph.D. qualifying oral\nexamination) no later than the end of the third academic year:\n\n\u25cf Complete 18 units of research in their field of interest.\n\n\u25cf Obtain approval of a course of study consisting of at least 135 units of\nadvanced courses in electrical engineering or the related subjects approved by\nthe Ph.D. adviser, with at least 54 units of letter-graded EE courses numbered\n100 or above. No more than 30 units of pass/fail grades may be counted toward\nthis requirement. The courses taken to satisfy the math requirement below and\ncourses taken to fulfill the Master of Science degree requirement may be\nincluded to satisfy this requirement. Units toward this requirement are not\ntransferable from other schools.\n\n\u25cf Pass 27 units of mathematics courses, as approved by the student\u2019s research\nadviser, with letter grade no lower than C.\n\n\u25cf Pass an oral candidacy examination.\n\n###  Ph.D. Committee\n\nThe Ph.D. qualifying oral exam and the final defense exam are conducted by\ncommittees that are set up by the student and approved by the option\nrepresentative. Members of these Ph.D. committees also serve as second or\nbackup mentors in cases where such additional advising and problem solving are\nappropriate.\n\n###  Thesis and Final Examination\n\nThe candidate is required to take a final oral examination covering the\ndoctoral thesis and its significance in and relation to their major field.\nThis final examination will be given no less than two weeks after the doctoral\nthesis has been presented in final form, and before its approval. This\nexamination must be taken at least four weeks before the commencement at which\nthe degree is to be granted. The committee must include the advisor, but\nanother member of the committee must be selected as chair.\n\n###  Advising and Thesis Supervision\n\nPeriodic meetings between the advising faculty and the graduate student are an\nintegral part of the Ph.D. program. These meetings should be at sufficiently\nfrequent intervals, as determined by the student and adviser. Students are\nalso encouraged to meet with other members of the Ph.D. committee, the option\nrepresentative, the executive officer, or Caltech\u2019s ombudsperson to discuss\nproblems relating to satisfactory progress.\n\n###  Med-EE Track Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\nThe track was established by Andrew and Peggy Cherng Department of Medical\nEngineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering at Caltech in the\nFall 2022. The single degree to be shown on the diploma is \"Ph.D. in Medical\nand Electrical Engineering\".\n\n**Admission to candidacy  \n** To be recommended for candidacy for the Med-EE Ph.D. program, each student\nmust do the following.\n\n  * **Complete a minimum of 156 units of courses**. The MedE requirement of 21 units of MedE courses plus the EE requirement of 135 units must be met. Cross-listed MedE/EE courses can be double counted.\n    * MedE course requirements\n      * Complete the three-term seminar sequence, MedE 100abc (1 unit), with a passing grade.\n      * Complete MedE 101 (9 units) with a passing grade.\n      * Complete a 9-unit MedE course.\n        * Biodevices: BE/EE/MedE 189ab (12 and 9 units), MedE 201 (9 units), MedE 202 (9 units), or MedE/EE 204 (9 units).\n        * Biomechanics/Fluidics: MedE/BE/Ae 243 (9 units), ChE/BE/MedE 112 (9 units), or ChE 103b (9 units).\n        * Biomedical Optics: MedE/EE 168abc (9 units each).\n        * Medical Imaging: MedE/EE 268 (9 units).\n      * All required courses must be taken for grades and passed with a grade no lower than C, except for those courses offered only for pass/fail.\n    * EE course requirements\n      * Complete 135 units total with no more than 30 units of pass/fail.\n      * Complete 54 units of letter-graded EE courses numbered 100 or above towards the 135-unit requirement.\n      * Complete 27 units of mathematics courses, with letter grade no lower than C. Many math-related courses can count towards the requirement after confirming with your advisor.\n      * Complete 18 units of research in your field of interest directed by your advisor.  \n\n  * **Pass the oral qualifying and oral candidacy exams** of the Electrical Engineering department for students having chosen Electrical Engineering as the home department. Please refer to the MedE Section for the reciprocal requirement.\n\n###  Thesis and final examination\n\nThe Med-EE Ph.D. thesis must be related to both options. The final thesis\ndefense exam is conducted by a committee that is set up by the student and\napproved by the option representative of the home department. The committee\nmust be composed of 2 members from each option. The committee must include the\nadvisor, but another member of the committee must be selected as chair. The\ncommittee chair must be a Caltech Professorial faculty member. This final\nexamination will be given no less than two weeks after the doctoral thesis has\nbeen presented in final form, and before its approval. This examination must\nbe taken at least four weeks before the commencement at which the degree is to\nbe granted. This thesis examination will be a defense of the doctoral thesis\nand a test of the candidate\u2019s knowledge in their specialized doctoral research\narea.\n\n##  EE Subject Minor\n\nA student majoring in another option at the Institute may elect a subject\nminor in electrical engineering. The student must obtain approval from the\nelectrical engineering faculty of a course of study containing at least 45\nunits (over the 100 level) of advanced courses with an EE listing (excluding\n291). At least 36 of these should be for letter grades no lower than C.\nUndergraduate first-year classes cannot be counted toward this.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program\n\nThe ESE graduate program trains doctoral students to solve fundamental\nproblems in environmental science and engineering. The problems cut across\ntraditional disciplinary boundaries and span space scales ranging from global\nto local. Students are trained to acquire a broad base of knowledge of\nenvironmental systems, including Earth\u2019s atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere.\nThey deepen their knowledge in one or more focus areas, culminating in\nresearch leading to a Ph.D. thesis. Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of\nresearch in the ESE program, the program unites faculty from the divisions of\nGeological and Planetary Sciences, Engineering and Applied Science, and\nChemistry and Chemical Engineering.\n\n###  Admission\n\nApplicants for admission to the ESE program should have undergraduate\npreparation in science, engineering, or mathematics. Admission is limited to\nstudents intending to pursue the Ph.D. degree. Only students who intend to\nwork full-time toward the Ph.D. degree are admitted. The admission process\nfollows Institute regulations.\n\n###  International Students\n\nIn order to be admitted for graduate study, students from non-English-speaking\ncountries are expected to read, write, and speak English and comprehend the\nspoken language. Although not required for admission, for applicants whose\nnative language is not English or have not received a degree from a university\nor college where English is the primary language of instruction, it is\nimportant to demonstrate a strong capability in English prior to admission to\nCaltech. This can be done by self-reporting scores from the Educational\nTesting Service (TOEFL), Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic), the\nCambridge Examinations and the International English Language Testing System\n(IELTS), or other services that provide a certified English-language\nproficiency examination. The ESE faculty may also arrange an online interview\nwhile assessing applications.\n\n###  Advising\n\nAn academic adviser is appointed for each incoming student to assist in\ndesigning their academic program. The research adviser is chosen by mutual\nagreement of the student and adviser during the second year of graduate study,\nafter passing the Ph.D. qualifying examination. The Thesis Advisory Committee\n(TAC), consisting of four Caltech faculty members including the research\nadviser, should be constituted and meet with the student soon after the\nstudent passes the qualifying examination; thereafter, it should meet with the\nstudent annually to review progress and provide guidance and support.\nCommittee membership may be changed if the student\u2019s research interests\nchange. The TAC generally serves to recommend the student\u2019s advancement to\ncandidacy; it may also serve as the examining committee for the final thesis\ndefense.\n\n##  ESE Master\u2019s Degree\n\nStudents enrolled in the Ph.D. program may be awarded a master\u2019s degree if\nthey have satisfied the basic Institute requirement of 135 units of work in\ncourses numbered 100 or higher. These courses must include those specifically\nrequired in the ESE Ph.D. program.\n\n##  ESE Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\nFor the Ph.D. degree, the student must (1) satisfy the course requirements,\n(2) pass the qualifying examination, (3) advance to candidacy, and (4)\ncomplete a thesis and successfully defend it in a final oral examination.\n\n###  Course Requirements\n\nDuring their first year, students, in consultation with their academic\nadvisers, must design a program of graduate study that includes a minimum of\n135 units of graduate work to be completed before the end of their third year.\nThe course program should take into account the students\u2019 individual\nbackgrounds and focus areas, educate them broadly in fundamental questions and\nmethods of contemporary environmental science and engineering, and prepare\nthem for their research. The course program must include the core courses ESE\n101, 102, and 103. Attendance at the weekly research seminars (ESE 104 and 110\nabc) is required for first-year students and is expected of all graduate\nstudents. All students are expected to have knowledge of methods of applied\nmathematics and statistics on the level of graduate courses at Caltech. In\ncases of unusual preparation, students may petition to substitute a similar\nbut more advanced course for one of the required courses.\n\nAdditionally, students are required to take 36 units of elective courses from\ntwo of the three groups below:\n\n  * Environmental Biology: ESE/Bi 166, ESE/Bi 168, Ge/ESE 170;\n  * Environmental Chemistry: ESE/Ch 175, ESE/Ch 176, ESE/Ge/Ch 171;\n  * Environmental Physics: ESE 130-138, Ge/ESE 139, Ge/ESE 150, ESE/ChE 158.\n\nThe remaining units of graduate work can be fulfilled by a combination of\nelective courses in ESE or related disciplines, reading or laboratory courses\n(ESE 100), and research (ESE 106, 300). Of the total required 135 units, no\nmore than 45 units may be in research. No more than 27 research units may be\ntaken during the first year of graduate study. Exceptions may be granted by\npetition.\n\nA grade of C- or better is required for all course work that satisfies these\nrequirements.\n\nIt is expected that each graduate student will, as part of the Ph.D.\ngraduation requirement, serve as a teaching assistant for one course per year,\nfollowing completion of the qualifying exam.\n\n###  Ph.D. Qualifying Examination\n\nThe Ph.D. qualifying examination must be taken during the first term of the\nstudent\u2019s second year of residency. This examination consists principally of\nan oral defense of two research propositions, each advised by a different\nfaculty member. Written abstracts must be submitted for both propositions, and\none of them must be described in the form of a research report or proposal.\nThe qualifying exam also covers the material of the ESE core courses and of\nthe elective courses the student has taken. In preparation for the qualifying\nexamination, students are encouraged to register for nine units of research\n(ESE 106) in their second and third terms of residency.\n\n###  Advancement to Candidacy\n\nStudents are recommended to advance to candidacy following the successful\ncompletion of a candidacy exam with their Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC). The\nexam, consisting of both a written Ph.D. thesis proposal and an oral\npresentation of this plan is required, and must be approved by all TAC\nmembers. Advancement to candidacy, including all required course work, should\nbe completed before the end of spring term in the student\u2019s third year of\nresidency.\n\n###  Thesis and Final Examination\n\nCopies of the completed thesis must be provided to the examining committee two\nweeks before the final oral examination. The final oral examination focuses on\nthe work of the thesis and, according to Institute regulations, must be held\nat least two weeks before the degree is conferred.\n\n###  ESE Subject Minor\n\nGraduate students majoring in another option at the Institute may elect a\nsubject minor in ESE. The ESE minor is intended to supplement one of Caltech\u2019s\ngraduate degrees and is designed for students who wish to broaden and deepen\ntheir expertise with knowledge in ESE. To complete an ESE subject minor,\ngraduate students must enroll in a program of study approved by the ESE option\nrepresentative, which is to include at least 36 units over two or more terms\nof graduate-level ESE classes (ESE 100 and above) and 18 units over two or\nmore terms of research under ESE 106 or ESE 300. At least one of the graduate-\nlevel ESE classes must be ESE 101, ESE 102, or ESE 103.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program\n\nStudents in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences study the earth\nand planets to understand their origin, constitution, and development, and the\neffect of the resulting physical and chemical characteristics on the history\nof life, on the environment, and on humanity. Broad training in the\nfundamental sciences enriched by more specialized course work within the\ndivision forms the basis of the educational program. Students are encouraged\nto work with complex and often incomplete data sets, to undertake research in\nnatural settings such as in the field or at sea, and to use the many modern\nlaboratory facilities available within the division. Programs of study and\nresearch are pursued in environmental science and engineering, geobiology,\ngeochemistry, geology, geophysics, and planetary science. The curriculum is\nflexible so that students with diverse degrees in science and engineering may\ncarry out graduate work within the division. Interdisciplinary studies are\nencouraged and students may carry out academic and research programs within\nand between different divisions. The objective is to train students for future\nemployment in academic research, government, and industry.\n\n###  Admission and Entrance Procedures\n\nOnly students who intend to work full-time toward the Doctor of Philosophy\n(Ph.D.) degree are admitted. The admission process follows Institute\nregulations.\n\n###  International Students\n\nIn order to be admitted for graduate study, students from non-English-speaking\ncountries are expected to read, write, and speak English and comprehend the\nspoken language. Although not required for admission, for applicants whose\nnative language is not English or have not received a degree from a university\nor college where English is the primary language of instruction, it is\nimportant to demonstrate a strong capability in English prior to admission to\nCaltech. This can be done by self-reporting scores from the Educational\nTesting Service (TOEFL), Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic), the\nCambridge Examinations and the International English Language Testing System\n(IELTS), or other services that provide a certified English-language\nproficiency examination. The GPS faculty may also arrange an online interview\nwhile assessing applications.\n\nBased on their applications and interests, students enter one of the major\nsubject options of the division and are given an academic adviser who is a\nprofessorial faculty member associated with the option. The six options are\nenvironmental science and engineering, geobiology, geochemistry, geology,\ngeophysics, and planetary science. Students may later change options, but must\nfirst obtain approval from the new option. Each student must plan to satisfy\nthe requirements for the Ph.D. degree in one option.\n\nEntering students in the week preceding the beginning of instruction for the\nfirst term meet with their option representatives to discuss their preparation\nin the basic sciences and select a series of courses that will best prepare\nthem for research in their chosen field while meeting the requirements set\nforth below.\n\nFirst-year graduate students are encouraged to register for at least nine\nunits of research (Ge 297) in each term of residence. The primary objective is\nto communicate to the students the excitement of discovery based on original\ninvestigations and to provide a broad scope of research aims. An important\nbyproduct can be the formulation of propositions for the Ph.D. qualifying oral\nexamination or orientation toward Ph.D. research.\n\n###  Advising and Thesis Supervision\n\nThe option representative for each incoming student will act as the academic\nadviser in the first term. An academic adviser will be assigned by the start\nof second term. This appointed adviser will continue as mentor with broad\nresponsibility for a student\u2019s academic welfare throughout the graduate\nprogram. During the second year, after passing the qualifying examination,\neach student should identify a professor as thesis adviser, who will normally\nprovide a graduate research assistantship and the opportunity for continuing\nresearch. In consultation with the two faculty advisers, each student then\nforms a Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC), composed of at least four Caltech\nprofessors (chaired by the academic adviser). External scientists closely\ninvolved in the student\u2019s research may also be appointed. Members of the TAC\nserve as advisers, counselors, and resources, and its membership may be\nchanged if a student\u2019s research interests change.\n\nThe TAC meets with the student at least once each year for a progress review,\nand informally whenever the student needs or requests assistance or guidance.\nIn addition, the faculty members in each option have their own systems for\nannual evaluations of student progress. A few months before completion of the\nthesis dissertation, the thesis examining committee will be chosen, usually\nincluding the members of the Thesis Advisory Committee.\n\nAll students are urged to consult with division faculty in the following\nsequence if they have any problems: thesis and academic advisers, Thesis\nAdvisory Committee, option representative, academic officer, and division\nchair. If these division personnel cannot resolve a problem, then the student\nshould turn to Institute offices.\n\n##  GPS Master\u2019s Degree\n\nStudents enrolled in the Ph.D. program may be awarded a master\u2019s degree when\nthey have satisfied the basic Institute requirement of 135 units. These\ncourses must be part of a plan of study approved by the option representative,\nnumbered 100 or higher, and part of those used to satisfy the Ph.D.\nrequirement in one of the options of the division. A minimum of 72 units\nshould be taken as courses, rather than research or independent study units.\nSpecifically required are two courses from the list Ge 101, Ge 102, Ge 103, Ge\n104, or ESE 101, ESE 102, ESE 103.\n\nAn application for admission to candidacy for an M.S. degree must be submitted\nin REGIS according to the [academic calendar](/current/academic-calendar/) in\nthe _Caltech Catalog_.\n\n##  GPS Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\n###  Division Requirements\n\nFor a Ph.D. degree, the student must 1) pass the qualifying oral examination,\n2) satisfy course requirements of the division and of an option, and 3)\ncomplete a thesis and successfully defend it in a final oral examination.\nRecommendation to the dean of graduate studies for admission to candidacy\noccurs after the student has satisfied the first two requirements and has been\naccepted for thesis research by a division faculty member, who then becomes\nthe student\u2019s thesis adviser.\n\nThe qualifying examination consists of oral and written defense of two\nresearch propositions, supplemented by a written description of one of them.\nStudents are encouraged to consult with various faculty members concerning\ntheir ideas on propositions, but the material submitted must represent the\nwork of the student. There must be a different faculty member associated with\neach of the two propositions. The exam is normally taken early in the first\nterm of the second year of residence and is administered by the qualifying\nexamination committee, which has members from the six options of the division.\nA more detailed outline of the qualifying examination is available on the\ndivision website.\n\nBy the end of the fall term of the second year, students are expected to\nselect a thesis adviser(s) and before the end of the second year, the Thesis\nAdvisory Committee will be selected, as outlined above. The division\nencourages students to engage in research early in their graduate careers.\nStudents making normal progress will submit papers to refereed journals that\nhave been approved by a faculty member of the division. The final oral\nexamination for the doctorate by the thesis examining committee will be\nscheduled no sooner than two weeks following submission of the thesis\n(approved by the thesis adviser) and, in conformity with Institute\nregulations, it must be scheduled at least two weeks before the degree is to\nbe conferred.\n\nCandidates are expected to publish the major results of their thesis work. The\npublished papers should have a California Institute of Technology address.\nPublished papers may be included in the thesis.\n\nBy the end of the first academic year (third term): submission by the student\nof (1) tentative titles of propositions for review by the qualifying\nexamination committee and (2) a list of courses planned to satisfy the Ph.D.\nrequirement, for review by the option.\n\nBy the end of the second academic year: (1) passage of oral exam; (2) approval\nby the option of courses planned to satisfy candidacy requirements; (3)\nsubmission of a tentative thesis topic and adviser, and Thesis Advisory\nCommittee.\n\nBy the end of the third academic year: (1) satisfactory completion of course\nrequirements; (2) satisfactory completion of other requirements including\nselection of thesis topic and adviser, and Thesis Advisory Committee; (3)\nadmission to candidacy. A student who has not been admitted to candidacy by\nthe end of the third year will need permission of the academic officer to\nregister.\n\nBy the end of the fourth academic year: satisfactory progress toward\ncompletion of thesis.\n\nAfter completing the fifth academic year, the student must formally petition\nto register for each subsequent year. Financial aid will normally not be\nextended beyond the sixth year.\n\nThe student\u2019s program and progress will be reviewed annually by their option\nand by the Thesis Advisory Committee. In cases where, in the opinion of the\nfaculty in the option, the student is clearly not showing adequate progress,\nthey may recommend to the division chair that the student be denied permission\nto continue in the Ph.D. program based upon their overall assessment of the\nstudent\u2019s performance.\n\n###  Basic Division Course Requirement\n\nDuring the first year, every graduate student will take two of the seven basic\nintroductory courses Ge 101\u2013104 and ESE 101\u2013103, in areas in which the student\nhas not had substantial training. These should be completed during the first\nyear. Throughout their graduate careers, students are expected to attend\ndepartmental seminars and seminar courses led by visiting scientists.\n\nBeginning in the second academic year, students are required to serve as\nteaching assistants for one quarter per year they are in residence.\n\n##  GPS Requirements of the Major Subject Options\n\n###  Geobiology\n\nIn addition to the general Institute and basic division requirements,\ncandidates for the Ph.D. degree in geobiology must successfully complete a\nminimum of 90 units at the 100 or greater level, including Ge 104; either\nBi/Ch 110, Bi/CNS/NB 195, or Ge/ESE 118; and two courses from each of the\nfollowing three subject menus:\n\n  * _Geology_ : Ge 106, 112, 114 ab, 124 ab, Ge/ESE 125.\n  * _Chemistry:_ Ge/ESE 143, 149, Ge 140 ab, ESE/Ge/Ch 171, 172, ESE/Ch 175, 176.\n  * _Biology:_ ESE/Bi 166, 168, Ge/ESE/Bi 178, Bi 117, ESE 103.\n\nOther classes may be substituted for these menu requirements with the approval\nof the option representative. A student with substantial prior experience in\ngeobiology (e.g., an M.S. degree) may use prior course work to substitute up\nto 45 of these units with the approval of the geobiology option\nrepresentative. A grade of C- or better is required for all course work that\nsatisfies these requirements. All students must have a basic knowledge of\norganic chemistry at the level of Ch 41 a. This requirement may be met by\nprevious course work or through successful completion of this class.\nGeobiology students must complete one term (6 units) of Ge 109 (Oral\nPresentation) as an independent study with a faculty member of their choosing,\ntypically the thesis adviser.\n\n###  Geochemistry\n\nIn addition to general Institute and basic division requirements, candidates\nfor the Ph.D. degree in geochemistry are required to take one term of Ge 109\nin the geochemistry option and are required to demonstrate an understanding of\nthe field through a total of 90 units of course work at the 100 level or\nhigher spread over four of the subdisciplines offered in the option:\npetrology/mineralogy, isotope geochemistry, cosmochemistry, water\nchemistry/oceans, atmospheres, biogeochemistry, or advanced chemistry. A grade\nof C- or better is required for all course work that satisfies these\nrequirements. All students must have a basic knowledge of chemistry at the\nlevel of Ch 21 and mathematics at the level of Ge 108. If appropriate, Ch 21\nabc may be included as part of these units, and other courses below the 100\nlevel may be included at the discretion of the option representative. With the\napproval of the geochemistry option representative, a student with substantial\nprior experience in some of the subdisciplines may use prior course work to\nsubstitute for up to 45 of these units and students entering with a master\u2019s\ndegree in science or mathematics may be exempt from up to 45 units. In the\noral candidacy exam, the student will be subject to examination in all four of\nthe chosen subdisciplines.\n\n###  Geology\n\nThe geology option requirements are (1) two of Ge 102, 103, 104, or ESE 101,\nESE 102, ESE 103, which also satisfy the basic division requirement; (2) 36\nunits of advanced field geology, in the form of three terms of Ge 121 abc\ntaken from three different instructors; (3) 54 additional units in 100- or\n200-level science, math or engineering courses in any field at Caltech. Ch 21\nabc may be included as part of these units, and other courses below the 100\nlevel may be included at the discretion of the option representative. Courses\nthat cannot be used to satisfy these requirements include research and reading\ncourses, and certain courses constituting basic preparation in the field of\ngeology, such as Ge 106, Ge 112, Ge 114 ab, and Ge 115 ab. A grade of C- or\nbetter is required for all course work that satisfies these requirements.\nKnowledge of basic physics, mathematics, and data analysis at the level of Ge\n108 and Ge/Ay 117 is required of all Ph.D. candidates in geology. Students\nentering the geology option with a master\u2019s degree in a science or mathematics\nmay be exempt from up to 45 units at the discretion of the option\nrepresentative. Geology students are required to give a 30-minute\npresentation, including 10 minutes of discussion, on their research at the\nGeoclub Seminar series before admission to candidacy.\n\n###  Geophysics\n\nIn addition to general Institute requirements, candidates for the Ph.D degree\nin geophysics must successfully complete the following: (1) two of the\nfollowing basic introductory courses: Ge 101, 103, 104, or ESE 101\u2013103, and\none term of Ge 109 per year from the second year until the last year prior to\nobtaining the degree; (2) either Ae/Ge/ME 160 ab, APh 105 ab, MS 115, or a\nsubject equivalent; (3) three of Ge 161, Ge 162, Ge 163, or Ge 164; (4) Ge 111\nab; (5) the choice between five additional 100- or 200-level science or\nmathematics courses or a minor in any field at Caltech (for example,\ncomputational science and engineering). It is highly recommended that (1)-(4)\nbe fulfilled in the first year and (5) in the second year. A grade of C- or\nbetter is required for all course work that satisfies these requirements.\nKnowledge of basic physics, mathematics, and data analysis at the level of Ge\n108 and Ge/Ay 117 is required of all Ph.D. candidates in geophysics. This\nrequirement may be met by previous course work or through successful\ncompletion of these classes. Students may substitute another course for a\nrequired course if they can demonstrate to an option representative that they\nhave already had the material in the required course.\n\n###  Planetary Science\n\nIn addition to general Institute and basic division requirements, candidates\nfor the Ph.D. degree in planetary science must satisfy the following course\nrequirements: Ge 101, Ge 102, and courses in planetary formation and dynamics\n(Ge/Ay 133), planetary atmospheres (Ge/ESE 150), planetary interiors (Ge 131),\nand planetary surfaces (Ge 151). In addition, students shall successfully\ncomplete 45 units of 100-level or higher courses in a coherent field of\nspecialization. This requirement may be satisfied by completion of a subject\nminor or through a set of courses chosen in consultation with and approved by\nthe adviser and the option representative. A grade of C- or better is required\nfor all course work that satisfies these requirements. All candidates are\nexpected to possess knowledge of physics and mathematics at the level of Ge\n108. This requirement may be met by previous coursework or through successful\ncompletion of this class. Higher-level mathematics and physics courses are\nstrongly encouraged.

After completing the\nPh.D. program, students have pursued careers in teaching and research at\ncolleges and universities, in research for government and industry, in the\noperation and control of manufacturing processes, and in management and\ndevelopment positions in the materials industry.\n\nStudents may enter the graduate program in materials science with\nundergraduate preparation in physics, chemistry, engineering, or materials\nscience. Students interested in terminating their graduate study at the\nmaster\u2019s level are not normally admitted. Students in the Ph.D. program are\nrequired to complete a set of core courses, pass an oral candidacy\nexamination, complete a thesis describing original research in materials\nscience or a related field, and publicly defend their thesis work.\n\n##  MS Preparation for the Graduate Program\n\nStudents who have not specialized in materials science as undergraduates, as\nwell as those who have, may be admitted for graduate study. As preparation for\nadvanced study and research, entering graduate students are expected to have a\nthorough background in undergraduate mathematics, physics, and engineering. An\noutstanding four-year undergraduate program in mathematics and sciences is\nalso a suitable background. The qualifications of each applicant will be\nconsidered individually, and, after being enrolled, the student will arrange\ntheir course of study and research in consultation with members of the faculty\nand the materials science option representative.\n\n##  MS Master\u2019s Degree\n\nThe degree of Master of Science in materials science is only awarded to\nstudents who do not already have an M.S. degree in Materials Science. The\ndegree will be awarded upon request by students who have fulfilled the\nrequirements. Only in exceptional cases is there admission to the M.S. program\nas the final degree objective.\n\nEach student is assigned to a member of the faculty who will serve as the\nstudent\u2019s adviser. The adviser and option representative for materials science\nwill approve the student\u2019s course of study. Study for the degree of Master of\nScience in materials science will ordinarily require at least three terms of\ncourses. The courses shall be chosen from the list of core courses below,\nalthough 9 units of research (MS 200 or equivalent) may be substituted for 9\nunits of lecture or laboratory courses. Completion of 111 units of these\ncourses within two years with no grade less than a C constitutes the academic\nrequirements for the M.S. degree.\n\n###  Graduate Coursework\n\n  1.

Materials Research Lecture Seminar Series \u2013 3 units\n    1. MS 110 abc\n\n##  MS Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\nThe doctoral program in materials science consists of a series of preparatory\nclasses, followed by an oral candidacy exam, a written thesis, and a final\noral thesis defense. The goals of this program are to develop excellence in a\nchosen field of specialization; to develop tools with which to assess problems\noutside the student\u2019s field of specialization; to develop sufficient strength\nin the physical sciences for self-education beyond formal training; and to\ncultivate the motivation and foresight to become a productive and influential\nleader. As such, the graduate program in materials science is designed to be a\ndoctoral program and students are only admitted into the doctoral program.\nThere is no separate master\u2019s program in materials science.\n\nThe Ph.D. degree in materials science is focused on research. Study and\nresearch programs for the Ph.D. degree are individually planned to fit the\ninterests and background of the student. A comprehensive research project\nresulting in an original contribution to the field documented by a\ndissertation is required.\n\n###  Residency\n\nA minimum of three academic years in residence as a graduate student are\nrequired by the Institute, and two or more additional years are usually needed\nfor preparation of the thesis.\n\n###  Language Requirement\n\nThere is no language requirement for the Ph.D. degree.\n\n###  Minor\n\nNo minor is required for the Ph.D. degree. Students are, however, encouraged\nto take advanced courses appropriate to their particular interests.\n\n###  Advising and Thesis Supervision\n\nAn interim adviser is appointed for each student upon admission to a graduate\ndegree in materials science (typically the materials science option\nrepresentative). The interim adviser will serve as the primary mentor until\nthe student finds a research adviser. In the first year (no later than the\nthird term), each student must choose a research adviser who will have primary\nresponsibility for supervising the student\u2019s course program and research. The\nimportant adviser\u2013advisee relationship requires effort from both parties, and\nsome general expectations are outlined earlier in this section of the catalog.\nIn consultation with their research adviser, the student should then form a\nPh.D. Thesis Advisory Committee. This four-member committee should include:\n(i) the student\u2019s adviser, and (ii) at least three members of the Caltech\nprofessorial faculty. The research adviser and the Thesis Advisory Committee\nprovide the majority of mentoring to the student, offering advice on research,\nprogress toward the Ph.D., future careers, and other aspects of life in\ngraduate school and as a professional scientist.\n\n###  Requirements for Candidacy for the Ph.D. Degree\n\nTo be recommended for candidacy for the Ph.D. degree in Materials Science, the\nstudent must, in addition to meeting the general Institute requirements, do\nthe following:\n\n  1. _Courses._ To continue in the graduate program, the student must maintain a B\u2013 average for each term. Advancement to candidacy requires the successful completion of the program listed under \u201cCore Courses\u201d above. Alternatively, if the student has taken equivalent courses elsewhere, they may prove competency to the instructor of the equivalent course at the Institute and request a waiver of the required course. With the Core Course requirements 1-5, students must complete a minimum of 111 units of courses, numbered 100 or above, before presenting themselves for Ph.D. candidacy. The coursework towards the Ph.D. degree in materials science is typically completed within the first two years of residency at Caltech.\n    1. All courses must be passed with a grade of at least a C, except for courses taken on a pass/fail basis.\n    2. Students must complete the degree progress report online.\n    3. Alternate Subjects or Areas\n      1. Students entering the program with advanced preparation may choose either to substitute more advanced courses in the topical areas shown or demonstrate competency to the course instructor.\n      2. Students may petition the materials science option representative to accept alternative subjects or areas, but such petitions must be submitted before the student registers for the courses.\n  2. _Oral Candidacy Examination._ This examination should be taken no later than the end of the student\u2019s second year of residence. The student\u2019s research adviser must be on the examining committee, but cannot serve as chair of the committee. The examination is based on the student\u2019s coursework, and how it is related to the student\u2019s planned research area. The student will be expected to deliver a half-hour oral presentation describing research to-date and will answer questions related to this work. This portion of the examination will be followed by more open-ended questions to test general proficiency in materials science. Students who fail the oral examination on their first attempt will be given additional guidelines for further study and an opportunity to retake the examination a second and final time if the committee so recommends. Students who fail the oral examination a second time cannot continue with doctoral studies leading to the Ph.D. Upon recommendation of the examining committee, however, a student may be granted a terminal master\u2019s degree. The approval of the materials science option representative is necessary for registration beyond the third year of graduate residence without successfully completing the candidacy exam.\n  3. _Research Competence._ The student must have a doctoral research adviser, and must have completed at least 18 units of MS 200. Students who fulfill the requirements above will be recommended for candidacy to the doctoral program and a master\u2019s degree (if applicable) in materials science.\n\n###  Ph.D. Thesis Requirements\n\nThe candidate is to provide a draft copy of the completed thesis to the\nmembers of the examining committee (typically the same as the Thesis Advisory\nCommittee) at least two weeks before the final oral examination. The date of\nthe examination and the composition of the examining committee will not be\napproved by the dean of graduate studies until the thesis is submitted in\ncompleted form, i.e., ready for review by the dean, the members of the thesis\ncommittee, and the Graduate Office proofreader. Registration is required for\nthe term in which the thesis defense is undertaken, but is not normally\nallowed beyond the last date of the term. For more information, please see the\nsection entitled \u201cInformation for Graduate Students\u201d in the _Caltech Catalog_.\n\n###  Ph.D. Final Examination\n\nThe candidate is required to take a final oral examination covering the\ndoctoral thesis and its significance in and relation to materials science. It\nwill consist of a public thesis seminar and an associated oral examination on\nthe thesis and related fields. The examining committee must consist of the\nstudent\u2019s adviser and three members of the Caltech professorial faculty. The\nchair of the examining committee must be a Caltech professorial faculty member\ndistinct from the adviser. This examination will be held at least two weeks\nafter the doctoral thesis has been presented in its final form, and prior to\nits approval.\n\n###  Registration beyond the Sixth Year of Graduate Residence\n\nThe annual approval of the student\u2019s Thesis Advisory Committee or option\nrepresentative is necessary for registration beyond the eighteenth academic\nterm of graduate residence at Caltech. A petition to continue work toward the\nPh.D degree must also be approved by the dean of graduate studies.\n\n##  MS Subject Minor\n\nGraduate students majoring in another option at the Institute may elect a\nsubject minor in materials science. They must obtain approval from the\nmaterials science option representative for a course of study containing at\nleast 45 units of advanced courses with a grade of C or higher. Normally a\nmember of the materials science faculty will participate in the candidacy\nexamination in the student\u2019s major department.\n\n  * Students cannot use courses required by their major option in fulfillment of this requirement.\n  * Students interested in a minor must receive prior approval from the option representative in materials science, who will review and approve the proposed course of study.\n  * It is recommended that this course of study include advanced courses spanning different subfields of materials science.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program\n\nThe principal aim of the graduate program is to develop the student\u2019s ability\nto do original research in mathematics. Independent and critical thinking is\nfostered by direct contact with faculty members. (Read more about the [current\nresearch interests of the faculty](/current/areas-of-study-and-\nresearch/mathematics/).) Faculty advisers help students plan their programs of\nstudy leading to a Ph.D. in mathematics. Entering students are advised by the\ngraduate option representative, who assists them in selecting appropriate\ncourses, depending upon their previous studies.\n\n##  Ma Master\u2019s Degree\n\nEntering graduate students are admitted directly to the Ph.D. program, since\nthe Institute does not offer a regular program in mathematics leading to the\nmaster\u2019s degree. A master\u2019s degree may be awarded in exceptional circumstances\neither as a terminal degree or preliminary to the Ph.D. Sufficiently advanced\nundergraduates may be admitted to graduate standing to pursue a master\u2019s\ndegree simultaneously with the bachelor\u2019s program.\n\nThe recipient of a master\u2019s degree will be expected to take 135 units in\nadvanced mathematics (numbered 110 and higher). Unless the student has placed\nout of some of them, these must include Math 110, 120, and 151 (the basic\ncourses in analysis, algebra, and geometry) and at least two terms of discrete\nmathematics. Reading and/or research courses may only be included in this 135\nunits if approved by the executive officer for mathematics.\n\nThe general Institute requirements specify that the recipient of a master\u2019s\ndegree must have taken at least 135 units of graduate work as a graduate\nstudent at the Institute, including at least 81 units of advanced graduate\nwork in mathematics. This advanced work is interpreted as work with a course\nnumber greater than 109 and may include a master\u2019s thesis.\n\n##  Ma Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Course Program\n\nThe graduate courses are listed in section five. The three core course\nseries\u2014Ma 110 abc in analysis, Ma 120 abc in algebra, and Ma 151 abc in\ngeometry and topology\u2014are required of all graduate students. Students are\nexpected to complete each of the core course series during the first year of\nstudy, unless they complete the corresponding qualifying exam upon entrance to\nthe program (see section on qualifying exams). In addition, students are\nrequired to complete nine quarters of other advanced mathematics courses Ma\n111 and above, at least two of which are in discrete mathematics:\ncombinatorics, complexity, and computability, or logic and set theory. Unless\nthese nine course quarters are given pass/fail only, they must be taken for\ngrades. Reading and research do not normally qualify to meet these\nrequirements. Under special circumstances (e.g., finishing the degree in three\nyears), exceptions to these requirements may be considered by the graduate\noption representative. Beginning no later than the second year, students will\nbe expected to begin independent research work and will be strongly encouraged\nto participate in seminars.\n\n###  Qualifying Examinations\n\nQualifying examinations in the three core areas\u2014analysis, algebra, and\ngeometry/topology\u2014emphasize mastery of the basic concepts and theorems and the\nability to apply them to specific cases. Students are required to take and\npass two of the three examinations, and for the third not taken, students must\nearn a B or better in all three terms of the corresponding course series. The\nexams are offered at the beginning of the Fall term and end of the spring term\neach academic year, with exceptional offerings made at other times of the year\nif needed and approved by the graduate option representative. The examinations\nmust be attempted by the end of the spring term during the first year of\nstudy, and completed by the end of the first academic year. Entering students\nare permitted to take one or more qualifying examinations at the beginning of\nthe fall term of their first academic year. If completed successfully, the\nstudent may drop the corresponding core course and will be excused from the\nremainder of the corresponding core requirement. Special exceptions or\nextensions to the qualifying examination timeline may be considered by the\ngraduate option representative with support from the primary research adviser.\n\n###  Teaching Requirements\n\nTeaching is an integral part of the mathematics graduate education. It is\nexpected that students serve as teaching assistants in each term courses are\noffered unless alternative arrangements have been made with the option and\napproved by the executive officer.\n\n###  Summer Study\n\nAlthough there are no courses given in the summer, graduate students are\nexpected to carry out studies and research in their chosen area of\nmathematics. In the summer after the first year, they will work under the\nguidance of a faculty member to investigate a possible area for their thesis\nresearch.\n\n###  Thesis Advising and Tracking Committee\n\nIt is expected that by the fall quarter of the second year, students will find\na member of the faculty who agrees to serve as their thesis adviser. The\nformal change of adviser process should be complete by the end of the second\nacademic year.\n\nThe progress of all continuing students is assessed by the faculty each fall,\nand students will consult with their advisers about their progress and\nplanning of their studies and research. Students receive help and advice not\nonly from their thesis adviser and other faculty mentors, but also whenever\nneeded from the graduate option representative and the executive officer. (See\nalso the section with guidelines for graduate student advising.) In addition\nto the primary thesis adviser, each student will have a candidacy committee,\nThesis Advisory Committee (TAC), and final defense committee. In most cases,\nthe members of all of these committees are the same, but the student has the\nright to change the members. The student in consultation with their adviser\nwill arrange the formation of the committee, which will have at least four\nmembers and meet the requirements listed in the subsection Graduate Policies\nand Procedure entitled \u2018Degree of Doctor of Philosophy.\u2019 At least two of the\ncommittee members should be members of the mathematics professorial faculty\nand the chair of the committees must be a professorial faculty who is not the\nprimary research adviser.\n\n###  Admission to Candidacy\n\nBefore the end of their third year, students are expected to finish the\nprocess of applying for admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. This\nformal step requires completion of the qualifying examinations, core courses,\nand advanced courses, as well as a satisfactory oral presentation to a\ncommittee of faculty members. The presentation will describe both the general\narea of the student\u2019s proposed thesis research and the specific problem or\nproblems to be addressed. The candidacy meeting should be complete by the\nbeginning of the fourth year of study. It normally takes place during the\nspring term of the third year. In some cases, during the summer term of the\nthird year, but scheduling must be done by the end of the spring term. Special\nexceptions or extensions to the admission to candidacy timeline may be\nconsidered by the graduate option representative with support from the primary\nresearch adviser.\n\n###  Thesis Advisory Committee Meetings\n\nThe Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC) will track the student\u2019s progress through\nannual meetings between the candidacy exam and final defense. It is the\nresponsibility of the student to convene the TAC during the fourth and fifth\nyear of study. The fourth-year meeting should take place no later than the end\nof the winter term of the fourth year. The fifth-year meeting should take\nplace no later than the end of the fall term of the fifth year.\n\n###  Thesis and Final Examination\n\nAt least two weeks prior to the final thesis defense, candidates for the\ndegree of Doctor of Philosophy must deliver copies of their theses to their\nadvisers, to the Graduate Office, and to the members of the committee that\nwill conduct the final oral examination on the thesis. The examination must be\nheld at least three weeks before the date on which the degree will be\nconferred and at least two weeks after the delivery of the copies of the\nthesis.\n\n##  Ma Subject Minor\n\nStudents majoring in other fields may take a subject minor in mathematics.\nMinor programs must include 54 units of advanced work approved by a\nrepresentative of the mathematics department, who will ensure that the work\nrepresents a concentrated study in one or more of the main fields of\nmathematics. A special oral examination in the subject minor will be given\nsoon after completion of the minor program.\n\n"

The aim of the graduate program is to\nexpose each student to this breadth of the discipline. To accomplish this, we\noffer a first-year curriculum with requirements in specified areas, along with\na core course that spans many subjects. Students enter neurobiology from many\ndifferent disciplines, ranging from particle physics to physiology to\npsychology. Accordingly, each Ph.D. student is paired with a first-year\nadviser so the course selections can best complement the student\u2019s background.\nIn later years, the student\u2019s focus is on original research in a chosen\nspecialty. Our goal is that students will graduate with specific research\naccomplishments and the broad understanding required to chart their subsequent\nforays in brain science.\n\n##  NB Admission\n\nApplicants are expected to have studied college-level mathematics, physics,\nchemistry, and biology. They should also have experience in independent\nresearch. Coursework in neurobiology and experience in scientific computing\nare helpful, but not required. Whenever possible, applicants will be\ninterviewed on campus before final admission decisions are made.\n\n##  NB Master\u2019s Degree\n\nThe option does not admit students for work toward the master's degree. A\nterminal M.S. may be awarded in exceptional circumstances.\n\n##  NB Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\n###  First-year adviser\n\nEach incoming student is paired with an academic adviser during the first\nyear. This mentor will guide the student in course selection and other\ndecisions, taking the student\u2019s background into account. Where possible, this\nadviser will not be one of the prospective rotation supervisors.  \n\n###  Rotations\n\nFirst-year students carry out three laboratory rotations, each lasting one\nquarter. At least two of these should be with faculty participating in the\noption. By June 30 of the first year, students choose a Ph.D. adviser.\n\n###  Formal Classes\n\nStudents take at least 6 quarter courses (54 units) as follows:\n\n  1. Bi/CNS/NB 164, Tools of Neurobiology\n  2. Bi 252, Responsible Conduct of Research\n  3. One course in molecular, cellular, developmental  \nneurobiology\n\n  4. One course in circuits, systems, behavioral biology\n  5. One course in mathematical methods (depending on the student\u2019s background)\n  6. Two electives\n\nFor a list of courses in subject areas 3\u20135, see the option website. All\ncourses must be taken for a grade unless only offered pass/fail.\n\n###  Teaching\n\nAll students are to serve as teaching assistants for at least two terms.\n\n###  Admission to Candidacy\n\nTo qualify for candidacy, the student must first demonstrate broad competence\nby passing each of the first-year courses with a grade of B or higher. Failure\nhere can be remedied by successful second-year coursework. By June 30 of the\nsecond year, the student must also defend a thesis proposal in an oral exam\nbefore a qualifying exam committee of at least three faculty. This exam will\nalso cover general knowledge in the relevant field. With special permission,\nthe oral exam may be retaken once before the end of winter quarter of the\nthird year. Students that do not advance to candidacy by the end of the third\nyear may not continue in the program.\n\n###  Thesis Advisory Committee\n\nOnce admitted to candidacy, the student chooses a Thesis Advisory Committee of\nat least three faculty. This committee serves as a source of advice\nindependent of the Ph.D. adviser throughout the student\u2019s tenure. Each year,\nbefore the end of June, the student delivers a written progress report,\nfollowed by a meeting with the Thesis Advisory Committee.\n\n###  Thesis Examination Committee\n\nThis committee should consist of a minimum of four voting members, three of\nwhom must be Caltech faculty. The final oral examination covers principally\nthe work of the thesis, and according to Institute regulations must be held at\nleast three weeks before the degree is to be conferred.\n\n"

        "content": "##  Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program\n\nThe physics option offers a program leading to the degree of Doctor of\nPhilosophy. This program prepares students for careers in scientific research\nor research combined with teaching, and so its most important part is\nindependent research. Courses are offered that give a broad treatment of both\nfundamental physics and specialized physics research topics. These are\nintended both to help a beginning graduate student prepare for research and to\nbroaden an advanced student\u2019s knowledge of physics. Caltech research\nopportunities include elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, cosmic-\nray, gamma-ray, and X-ray astronomy, submillimeter astronomy, condensed-matter\nphysics, atomic/molecular/optical physics, quantum information, applied\nphysics, gravitational physics, cosmology, astrophysics, mathematical physics,\nbiophysics, and theoretical physics.\n\nA Master of Science degree may be awarded upon completion of a program of\ncourses. Students are not normally admitted to work toward the M.S. in physics\nunless they are also working toward a Ph.D.\n\n###  Admission\n\nThe application submission deadline for physics is December 15. The admission\nprocess follows Institute regulations.\n\n##  Ph Master\u2019s Degree\n\nA Master of Science degree in physics will be awarded, upon request, to\nphysics Ph.D. students who have completed the oral and written candidacy\nexaminations. Alternatively, a master\u2019s degree will be awarded to any Caltech\ngraduate student in good standing upon satisfactory completion of a program\napproved by the option representative that fulfills the following\nrequirements:\n\n**Ph 125 abc** |  **27 units**  \n---|---  \n(If this course, or its equivalent, was taken as part of an undergraduate program, it may be replaced by 27 units of any quantum-mechanics\u2013based course.)  |   \n**Physics electives** |  **81 units**  \nThese must be selected from physics courses numbered 100 and above.  |   \n**Other electives** |  **27 units**  \nThese must be graduate courses from any option at Caltech.  |   \n  \nSubstitutions of other graduate courses in place of the above requirements\nmust be approved by the option representative.\n\nIn exceptional cases, undergraduate students may receive concurrent B.S./M.S.\ndegrees if the above requirements are met in addition to the relevant B.S.\nrequirements, upon approval from the Physics Graduate Committee, the graduate\nadmissions committee, and the physics executive officer. Such students must\nproduce a detailed petition demonstrating accomplishments that would warrant\nnormal admission to the physics graduate program.\n\n##  Ph Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\nIn addition to the general Institute requirements for a Ph.D., the particular\nrequirements for a doctorate in physics include admission to candidacy as\ndescribed below, writing a thesis that describes the results of independent\nresearch, and passing a final oral examination based on this thesis and\nresearch. Physics graduate students may exercise the pass/fail option on any\nand all courses taken.\n\n###  Advising structure and thesis supervision\n\nAn academic adviser is appointed for each student upon admission to the\ngraduate program in physics. The academic adviser will serve as the primary\nmentor until the student finds a research adviser. Students will meet with\ntheir academic adviser to decide on their first-year course schedule, and are\nencouraged to continue these meetings quarterly until the student finds a\nresearch adviser. During the first year of study, students should consult with\ntheir academic adviser, the option representative, the executive officer,\nand/or individual faculty members to select a tentative research group. Once a\nresearch adviser is selected students may either replace the originally\nappointed academic adviser or maintain both a research adviser and academic\nadviser. At any time, a student may consult with the option representative\nconcerning such matters as advising.\n\nStudents should consult with the executive officer to assemble their oral\ncandidacy committee and Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC) by the end of their\nthird year. The TAC is normally constituted from the candidacy examiners, but\nstudents may propose variations or changes at any time to the option\nrepresentative. The TAC chair is normally someone other than the research\nadviser. The TAC chair will typically also serve as the thesis defense chair,\nbut changes may be made in consultation with the executive officer for physics\nand the option representative.\n\nThe candidacy committee will examine the student\u2019s knowledge of their chosen\nfield and will consider the appropriateness and scope of the proposed thesis\nresearch during the oral candidacy exam. This exam represents the formal\ncommitment of both student and adviser to a research program. After the oral\ncandidacy exam, students will hold annual meetings with the TAC. The TAC will\nreview the research progress and provide feedback and guidance towards\ncompletion of the degree.\n\nThe TAC, research, and/or academic advisers provide the majority of mentoring\nto the student. In addition, the option representative and other members of\nthe faculty are always available to provide advice and mentoring on any aspect\nof research, progress toward the Ph.D., future careers, and other aspects of\nlife in graduate school.\n\n###  Basic Physics Requirement\n\nPhysics students must demonstrate proficiency in all areas of basic physics,\nincluding classical mechanics (including continuum mechanics), electricity and\nmagnetism, quantum mechanics, statistical physics, optics, basic mathematical\nmethods of physics, and the physical origin of everyday phenomena. A solid\nunderstanding of these fundamental areas of physics is considered essential\nand proficiency will be tested by two written candidacy examinations.\n\nNo specific course work is required for the basic physics requirement, but\nsome students may benefit from taking several of the basic undergraduate\ncourses, such as Ph 106, Ph 125, and Ph 127. A syllabus describing the exam\ncontents will be available, and students are encouraged to study independently\nfor the exams, rather than taking a heavy load of basic physics courses. In\naddition, the class Ph 201 will provide additional problem solving training\nthat matches the basic physics requirement.\n\nThe written exams are typically offered in July and in October, and the two\nseparate exams may be taken at different times. This flexible scheduling of\nthe written exams allows students to prepare for the exams while\nsimultaneously learning about research areas, either through advanced courses,\nreading courses, or participation in a research group. The exams can be\nattempted up to three times and must be successfully completed by the end of\nthe second year of study.\n\n###  Advanced Physics Requirement\n\nIn addition to demonstrating a proficiency in basic physics, students must\nalso establish a broad understanding of modern physics through study in six\ngraduate courses. The courses must be spread over at least three of the\nfollowing four areas of advanced physics:\n\n  1. Physics of elementary particles and fields:  \nNuclear physics, high-energy physics, string theory\n\n  2. Quantum information and matter:  \nAtomic/molecular/optical physics, condensed-matter  \nphysics, quantum information\n\n  3. Physics of the universe:  \nGravitational physics, astrophysics, cosmology\n\n  4. Interdisciplinary physics:  \ne.g., Biophysics, applied physics, chemical physics,  \nmathematical physics, experimental physics  \n\nEach area is meant to be covered by the equivalent of a one-term course, and a\nlist of example courses for each of the areas can be found at the physics\noption website. Other courses may be substituted with permission of the\nphysics option representative.\n\n###  Oral Candidacy Exam\n\nThis exam is primarily a test of the candidate\u2019s suitability for research in\ntheir chosen field. The professor with whom the student plans to do research\nwill be a member of the exam committee, and normally the student will have\nalready begun research (Ph 172) on a definite topic with that professor. The\nexamination will cover the student\u2019s research work and its relation to the\ngeneral field of specialization. Before being allowed to take this exam, a\nstudent must have satisfied all the other requirements for admission to\ncandidacy. The oral candidacy exam should ideally be completed by the Spring\nterm of the third year, and no later than the Summer term of the third year\n(12th term) of graduate residence.\n\n###  Admission to Candidacy\n\nTo be recommended for Ph.D. candidacy, a student must pass two terms of\nPhysics Seminar (Ph 242), satisfy the Basic Physics Requirement by passing the\nwritten candidacy examinations, satisfy the Advanced Physics requirements, and\npass the Oral Candidacy Examination. These requirements are designed to ensure\nthat students have adequate preparation in the basic tools of physics, as well\nas a broad general knowledge of advanced physics.\n\n###  Research Requirements\n\nThere are no specific research requirements, but in general a substantial\neffort is required to master the techniques in a given field and carry out a\nsignificant piece of original research. Students are strongly advised to start\ndoing part-time research as soon as possible by taking reading and research\nunits (Ph 171\u2013172) in parallel with formal coursework.\n\n###  Teaching Requirement\n\nIt is expected that each graduate student will, as part of the Ph.D.\ngraduation requirements, serve as a teaching assistant for at least one term,\nan experience that most students find provides valuable experience for their\nfuture careers. Students are encouraged to fulfill this requirement within the\nfirst three years of residency.\n\n###  Thesis and Final Examination\n\nA final oral examination will be given not less than two weeks after the\nthesis has been presented in final form. This examination will cover the\nthesis topic and its relation to the general body of knowledge of physics. The\ncandidate is responsible for completing the thesis early enough to allow the\nfulfillment of all division and Institute requirements, with due regard for\npossible scheduling conflicts.\n\n###  Degree progress timeline\n\nThe following timeline is required for satisfactory degree progress:\n\n  1. Ph 242 should be taken by all students in their first year of graduate study.\n  2. The written candidacy exams should be attempted by the end of a student\u2019s first year of graduate residence, and be passed by the end of the second year. \n  3. The Advanced Physics requirement should be completed by the end of the second year of graduate residence, but may be extended into the third year depending on the availability of specific courses. \n  4. The oral candidacy exam must be completed by the end of the third year (12th term) of graduate residence.\n\n###  The Minor\n\nA minor is not required, but a student may elect to pursue a minor in another\noption.\n\n###  Language Requirements\n\nThere are no language requirements for a Ph.D. in physics.\n\n##  Ph Subject Minor\n\nStudents desiring a subject minor in physics should discuss their proposed\nprogram with the chair of the Physics Graduate Committee. Forty-five units\nfrom physics courses with numbers over 100 must be taken for the subject\nminor, excluding any specific courses in physics required for the student\u2019s\nmajor program. An oral exam may be required by the Physics Graduate Committee.\nThis exam will include both academic topics and topics on current physics\nresearch areas.\n\n"

It is designed to produce scholars\nwho are well grounded in the theoretical perspectives, the quantitative\ntechniques, and the experimental methods of economics and political science.\n\n##  SS Master\u2019s Degree\n\nStudents who are enrolled in the Social Science Ph.D. program may earn a M.S.\ndegree after successful completion of 36 units of course work, completed with\na grade of B or better in each class, in addition to completing the coursework\nrequired for the first year of the Ph.D. program.\n\n##  Admission\n\nDetailed information on admission requirements can be found at\n[hss.caltech.edu/academics/graduate-studies/social-sciences-phd-\nprogram/admissions](https://www.hss.caltech.edu/graduate-studies/social-\nsciences-phd-program).\n\n##  Course Program\n\n_First year._ The first-year curriculum consists of the following three-\nquarter course sequences: Political Theory (SS 202abc); Foundations of\nEconomics (SS 205abc) and Econometrics (SS 222abc). Each class must be\ncompleted with a grade of B or better. During the spring term, students may\nenroll in SS 201c or suitable alternative graduate courses in lieu of sequence\nclasses. In addition, students must register for SS/Psy/CNS 285 each quarter\nit is offered during the academic year, and in each term enroll in an SS 300\ncourse.\n\nAt the end of the first year, the faculty will review the overall class\nperformance of each first-year student and assess the student\u2019s ability for\nclear self-expression in both oral and written English. A positive assessment\nof class performance is required for a student to remain in good standing in\nthe program. If class performance is judged unsatisfactory by the faculty,\nthey may terminate the student from the program.\n\nBefore the start of the second year, students are required to take a written\npreliminary examination, which has three components, each corresponding to one\nof the first-year course sequences (SS 202, SS 205, and SS 222). A student who\nachieves a grade of A- or higher in all three courses of a sequence will be\nexempted from taking the corresponding component of the exam. The grades given\nare Honors, Pass, and Fail. Students must achieve at least a Pass in all three\ncomponents. Students who fail a component may be given the opportunity to\nretake it before the start of the fall term by the faculty. The Social Science\nfaculty will then review the student\u2019s performance on the exam(s), and\nprogress, to date. If it is not satisfactory, they may terminate the student\nfrom the program by the beginning of the second year.\n\n_Second year._ Second-year courses provide additional training in various\nsubfields of the social sciences.\n\nIn the fall quarter, all second-year students are required to enroll in SS 224\nand at least 18 additional units of advanced social science courses. In the\nwinter and spring quarters, all second-year students are required to enroll in\nat least 27 units of advanced social science courses (three typical courses).\nThis includes SS 299 (winter term) for all second-year students. Additionally,\nin each term, students will enroll in 9 units of Research in Social Science\n(SS 300).\n\nAppropriate courses in other options, such as mathematics and computer\nscience, can be substituted for advanced social science classes, with the\npermission of the HSS division\u2019s option representative. All classes offered\nfor grades must be completed with a grade of B or better. Students may take\nindependent reading and study courses, but during the second year such courses\ndo not count toward the above requirements.\n\nStudents can tailor their second-year curriculum to their specific research\ninterests but are expected to include at least two second-year course\nsequences. Such course sequences include Foundations of Political Economy (SS\n210abc), Advanced Economic Theory (SS 211abc), Experimental Economics (SS\n212abc), Financial Economics (SS 213abc), Topics in Theoretical and Applied\nEconometrics (SS 223abc), Applied Empirical Methods in the Social Sciences (SS\n228abc), Theoretical and Quantitative Dimensions of Historical Development (SS\n229abc), and American and Comparative Politics (SS 231abc). Students may\npartially fulfill the second-year sequence requirement by taking a sequence of\ncourses in mathematics, such as Ma 108abc, Ma 110abc, Ma/ACM/IDS 140ab, or Ec\n181ab.\n\n_Third year._ Beginning in their third year, and in all subsequent years, all\nstudents must enroll in the 3-unit graduate student pro-seminar (SS 282abc)\nevery quarter. Every student must make a presentation in this class at least\nonce a year. Students in the third year may also enroll in additional courses,\nwith the approval of their adviser. Third year students are required to take\nSS 281 in the quarter it is offered. In each quarter, third year students\nshould enroll in Research in Social Science (SS 300) for the units remaining\nto reach 36 units.\n\n_Fourth and fifth years._ Students need to register for 33 units of SS 300 and\n3 units of the graduate student pro-seminar (SS 282abc).\n\n###  Progress in the program, and advancement to candidacy\n\nIn addition to the coursework and examinations described above, students must\nenroll in at least 36 units every quarter, including summer (SS 300) and\ncomplete the following requirements.\n\nBy May 1 of the second year, each second-year student must submit an outline\ndescribing a planned paper to their paper adviser, their second reader, and\nthe option representative. The second-year paper can be co-authored. If the\nco-author is another graduate student, only one of the students on the joint\nproject can use the paper to fulfill the requirement. The person using the\npaper for fulfilling the requirement is expected to do most of the actual\nwriting of the paper that is submitted. The final paper is due on September\n15. If the paper adviser and the second reader both find that a student\u2019s\nsecond-year paper is satisfactory, the student advances to the third year. If\nthey do not, the social science faculty, as a whole, will review the student\u2019s\npaper. If they decide that the paper is not satisfactory, they may terminate\nthe student from the program. At the end of the second year, the social\nscience faculty will also meet and assess each second-year student\u2019s ability\nfor clear self-expression in both oral and written English. Also, starting\ntheir second year, students are expected to TA a minimum of three quarters\nduring their graduate career.\n\nThird-year students must write a research paper and present it to the faculty\nbefore the start of the fourth year. The third-year paper can be co-authored,\nunder the same conditions that apply to the second-year paper, but not with\nCaltech faculty. It should be worked on in consultation with and under the\ndirection of the student\u2019s primary adviser. The option representative will\nappoint a second third-year paper reader, who must be a member of the social\nsciences professorial faculty. The adviser and second reader will monitor\nprogress and advise the student on the third-year paper. The paper and the\npresentation must demonstrate to the faculty that the student is capable of\nundertaking original research and presenting it to a scholarly audience.\n\nAfter completion of the third-year paper presentation, the social science\nfaculty evaluates the student\u2019s overall performance and research potential.\nThis review is based primarily upon the third-year paper, but the faculty also\nverifies that the student has satisfactorily completed all previous\nrequirements.\n\nIf this evaluation is favorable, the student is admitted to candidacy for the\nPh.D. If the faculty evaluation is unfavorable, the student may be terminated\nfrom the program.\n\n###  Organization of Thesis Committee\n\nBy October 1 of the third year, each student selects a primary adviser. The\nadviser must be a professorial member of the social science faculty at\nCaltech. It is possible to change advisers, in consultation with the option\nrepresentative, if a student\u2019s research interests change. Students, in\nconsultation with their adviser, must select two additional thesis committee\nmembers after the student has advanced to candidacy (normally by the beginning\nof their fourth year). After a student advances to candidacy, the division\nchairperson, in consultation with the option representative, shall select a\nfourth member of the committee with an eye to representing the diverse\ninterests of the social science faculty. One of the four members of the thesis\ncommittee may be emeritus faculty, research faculty, or an external scholar,\nwith the approval of the option representative and the dean of graduate\nstudies. The chair of the thesis committee must be someone other than the\nprimary adviser, who will be appointed by the social science option\nrepresentative in consultation with the primary adviser. The thesis committee\nwill also serve as the examination committee at the thesis defense.\n\n##  SS Degree of Doctor of Philosophy\n\nBy November 1 of their fourth year, students must complete a dissertation\nprospectus that outlines the proposed dissertation work and present a\ntentative schedule detailing when the components of the dissertation are to be\ncompleted. The prospectus must clearly identify a project, or dissertation\ncomponents, that should culminate in a job market paper at the beginning of\nthe student\u2019s fifth year (August before the start of the fifth year, in the\ncase of students who seek a position in political science). The prospectus\nmust be submitted to the thesis committee by November 1. Approval or rejection\nof it should be communicated by the principal adviser to the option\nrepresentative no later than December 1.\n\nBy May 1 of the fourth year, the student is required to convene a thesis\nprospectus seminar with their thesis committee. In this seminar, the student\nis to report on the current status of their dissertation research and outline\na plan and timeline for completing it. The seminar must be based on the\nstudent\u2019s planned job market paper, and a draft of this paper must accompany\nthe proposal. The student and the the-sis committee should reach a clear,\nmutual under-standing as to what additional work needs to be done to complete\nand to successfully defend their dissertation.\n\nAfter the dissertation is completed, the student, in consultation with their\nadviser, must schedule an oral thesis examination to defend their\ndissertation. The student must provide a written copy of their dissertation to\nthe option representative and all members of the examination committee, and\ncomplete the examination notification in Regis, not less than two weeks prior\nto the thesis examination date. The dissertation is expected to represent\npublishable, original research.\n\n"

The core idea behind this theory is to\nrearrange the mass of a reference measure to match a target measure. In\nparticular, optimal transport seeks a rearrangement that transports mass with\nminimal cost. The theory of optimal transport dates back to Monge in 1781,\nwith significant advancements by Kantorovich in 1942 and later in the '90s,\ne.g. by Brenier. In recent years, measure transport has become an\nindispensable tool for representing probability distributions and for defining\nmeasures of similarity between distributions. These methods enjoy applications\nin image retrieval, signal and image representation, inverse problems, cancer\ndetection, texture and color modelling, shape and image registration, and\nmachine learning, to name a few.

In experimental systems, it diminishes\nsignal to noise ratio and obfuscates patterns and weak signals. In theoretical\nsystems, it requires modelling by stochastic differential equations, whose\nsolutions can be analytically intractable except for the simplest of Gaussian\nprocesses. Research on classical and quantum systems has revealed, however,\nthat noise is essential when boosting hidden signatures by the phenomenon\nknown as stochastic resonance. Many different methods proposed for inducing\nstochastic resonance are now revolutionizing measurement and modeling in\nfields as wide ranging as nonlinear optics and photonics, quantum\ncommunication, SQUID devices, neurophysiology, hydrodynamics, climate research\nand finance.

How do our bodies manage to be victorious against these threats for so\nmany years, in most cases? Many people have some familiarity with aspects of\nthe answers now, due to COVID-19. But how can these defense mechanisms\nactually work, and how can they coordinate their actions to be effective and\nsafe? Why do they fail? This course will zoom between scales to introduce the\ncells that the body uses for immune defense and how they execute their roles,\nboth system-wide and at the molecular level. A central theme will be how the\nsystem is controlled by cellular \"software\" reading the genetic code, by\nultra-rapid evolutionary mechanisms, and by elegant cell-cell communication\nnetworks. Lectures and student presentations will be included. May be taken\npass/fail if taken in a first-year student's first year.

These new tools have allowed the biological\nsciences to use genetics and genomics to reveal the functional relationships\nof life forms across the biosphere as never before. The largest conceptual\nshift enabled by this new capacity is the discovery of the unexpected\ncomplexity of the invisible world of microbes. We have learned that their\ndiversity dwarfs that of animals and plants, and that they underlie the health\nof all corners of the biosphere and its inhabitants. In addition, genomic\nanalyses of microbes have revealed that they 'invented' almost every\nfundamental feature of biological systems, and that macroorganisms have\nprimarily added nuances as they build upon these essential foundations. This\ncourse aims to provide students with a comprehensive view of the structure and\nfunction of the biosphere, from its evolutionary history to its molecular\nunderpinnings and emergent ecological patterns. The integration of micro- and\nmacrobiology in an introductory biology course will allow students to both\nfocus on the fundamental principles driving life and to build a comprehensive\nconceptual framework for understanding biology, much as chemistry and physics\ndid in the 20th century as they developed a long-lasting framework for their\nintroductory courses.\n\nInstructors: McFall-Ngai, Ruby\n\nBi 1 x\n\n##  The Great Ideas of Biology: Exploration through Experimentation\n\n9 units (0-6-3) | first, third terms\n\nIntroduction to concepts and laboratory methods in biology.

This first part\ndelves into Consumer Choice Theory, where students will explore how\nindividuals make consumption decisions based on their preferences, budget\nconstraints, and the theory of utility maximization. Through a series of\nlectures and exercises, participants will learn to model consumer behavior and\nstudy how changes in market conditions affect consumer demand. Simultaneously,\nthe course will cover Firm Theory, examining how firms make production and\npricing decisions to maximize profits in competitive and non-competitive\nmarkets. Students will be introduced to the concepts of production functions,\ncost minimization, and profit maximization, alongside the analysis of market\nstructures and their impact on firm behavior. This dual focus provides a\ncomprehensive foundation for understanding the interactions between consumers\nand firms, setting the stage for more complex discussions on market\nequilibria, welfare economics, and policy implications in later parts of the\ncourse (Ec 121b). Through a blend of theoretical models and real-world\napplications, this course aims to develop critical thinking and analytical\nskills, preparing students for advanced studies in economics or careers that\nrequire a sophisticated understanding of how economies function at\nequilibrium.\n\nInstructor: Saito\n\nEc 121 b\n\n##  Theory of Value\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nPrerequisites: Ec 11 and Ma 1b (may be taken concurrently). Ec 121a is highly\nrecommended as background, but is not a prerequisite.\n\nBuilding on the foundational knowledge acquired in the first part of the\nAdvanced General Equilibrium course (Ec 121a), this second half of the course\nventures into the study of Partial Equilibrium Analysis, Welfare Theorems, and\nMarket Failures. Students will engage with Partial Equilibrium Analysis to\nunderstand the equilibrium conditions of specific markets in isolation,\nappreciating how changes in supply and demand in one market can impact prices\nand quantities without considering the economy-wide effects. This segment sets\nthe groundwork for a deeper exploration of economic efficiency and resource\nallocation through a blend of theoretical insights and case studies. Then the\ncourse explores the First and Second Welfare Theorems, highlighting how, under\nideal conditions, markets can achieve optimal social outcomes. The First\nWelfare Theorem shows that competitive markets lead to Pareto efficiency,\nwhere improving one's situation without harming another is impossible. The\nSecond Theorem suggests that any Pareto efficient outcome can be reached\nthrough market equilibrium with correct resource distribution. However, real-\nworld deviations such as monopolies, public goods, and externalities are\nexamined to understand market failures and the potential for government\nintervention to enhance social welfare. This section equips students with the\ntools to evaluate economic policies, their efficiency, and their impact on\nsociety.\n\nInstructor: Saito\n\nEc 122\n\n##  Econometrics\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nPrerequisites: Ma 3.\n\nThe application of statistical techniques to the analysis of economic data.\n\nInstructor: Sherman\n\nEc 123\n\n##  Analysis of Consumer Choices\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nPrerequisites: Ec 122 is recommended but is not a prerequisite.\n\nThis course uses econometric tools to analyze choices made by people among a\nfinite set of alternatives.

We then make decisions, for better or for worse, based on these\nconclusions. A simultaneously intoxicating and sobering thought! Strong\nassumptions about the data generating process can lead to strong but often\nless than credible (perhaps incredible?) conclusions about our world. Weaker\nassumptions can lead to weaker but more credible conclusions. This course\nexplores the range of inferences that are possible when we entertain a range\nof assumptions about how data is generated. We explore these ideas in the\ncontext of a number of applications of interest to social scientists.\n\nInstructor: Sherman\n\nEc 125\n\n##  Understanding Behavioral Heterogeneity\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nPrerequisites: permission of instructor.\n\nThis course will review existing data in several areas of controlled economic\ndecision-making with a focus on individual and group differences.

A convincing data analysis starts with the\ncollection and cleaning of data, a thoughtful and reproducible statistical\nanalysis of it, and the graphical presentation of the results. This course\nwill provide students with the necessary practical skills, chiefly revolving\naround statistical computing, to conduct their own data analysis. This course\nis not an introduction to statistics or computer science. I assume that\nstudents are familiar with at least basic probability and statistical concepts\nup to and including regression.\n\nInstructor: Katz\n\nPS/Ec 128\n\n##  Introduction to Public Health Economics and Policy\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course will cover the basic concepts and principles of health economics\nand challenges in health policy implementation.

From Grendel, the monstrous foe of Beowulf, to Satan,\nMilton's charismatic antihero, this seminar examines the uses of the marvelous\nin a variety of texts and genres, including Shakespearian drama, medieval\nromance, and early travel-writing. Readings may include Beowulf, Marie de\nFrance, Chaucer, John Mandeville, Shakespeare, Milton. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Jahner\n\nHum/En 22\n\n##  Inequality\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second, third terms\n\nThis class studies a sample group of social hierarchies and explores whether\nthey are natural or artificial, real or perceived, just or unjust. Topics from\npast years have included covid-19 vaccine inequality; IT worker inequality;\nhappiness inequality; animal inequality; and inequality between humans and\ngenerative AI chatbots. We will treat the idea of inequality not as an\nabstract concept but as a heuristic question that can help us compare and\nanalyze concrete readings.\n\nInstructor: Haugen\n\nHum/En 23\n\n##  Literature and Medicine\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThe relationship between patients and doctors, the ill and the well, involves\na constant exchange of stories. In this course we will look more closely at\nthe relationship between medicine and narrative through a selection of\nfiction, essays and poems that investigate the interplay between doubt and\ndiagnosis, the idea of the case study, the problem of medical responsibility,\nand the language of pain and illness. Authors covered may include Sontag,\nMantel, Conan Doyle, Freud, Woolf, Dickinson, Ishiguro and Shelley.\n\nInstructor: Gilmore\n\nHum/En 24\n\n##  The Scientific Imagination in English Literature\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis course considers three periods of major scientific development-the\nRenaissance, the nineteenth century, and the modern period- to explore the\ninfluence new ideas, discoveries, and theories had on the imagination of\nEnglish writers. We will look at the early modern interplay between magic and\nscience, Romantic and Victorian debates about evolution, and the twentieth-\ncentury advent of modern physics as we confront consistent tropes like the mad\nscientist, the scientist-hero, and the problem of uncertainty. Authors covered\nmay include Shakespeare, Marlowe, Bacon, Shelley, Darwin, Conan Doyle,\nStevenson, Auden, McEwan, and Stoppard. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Gilmore\n\nHum/En 25\n\n##  The Human Animal\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nEuropean literature has long been a testing ground for radical new ideas which\nhave come to shape our basic understanding of what it means to be a thinking,\nspeaking and perhaps even autonomous human being. The question of what - if\nanything - makes us different from animals was debated from numerous points of\nview: including talking dogs, philosophizing women, bestial men, humanlike\nbeasts, and other creatures that defied the conventions of the time. This\ncourse explores some of the key literary texts that shaped this debate and\npays careful attention to their cultural environments. Selected readings from\nCervantes, La Fontaine, Swift, Rousseau, Buffon, Aikin, and Wollstonecraft,\namong others. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nHum/En 26\n\n##  What Is Imagination?\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nAlbert Einstein once said that imagination is everything, and even more\nimportant than knowledge. This course invites you to think about - and use -\nyour imagination as we explore how the act of imagining has been viewed over\ntime in the service of memory and creativity, in both the arts and the\nsciences. Readings will focus on the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and\nwill include Hume, Moritz, Kant, Novalis, Hoffmann, Coleridge, and Wordsworth.\nNot offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nHum/En 27\n\n##  Introduction to the Modern Novel\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course is an introduction to the study of the contemporary novel in\nEnglish. We will explore the value of reading novels both for their own sake\nand for what they might tell us about the history, culture, and politics of\nthe contemporary English language. We will read around three novels from the\ntwenty-first century, along with relevant essays, keywords, and short stories.\nAuthors read may include Zadie Smith, Bernadine Evaristo, Angie Cruz, Tommy\nOrange, Julie Buntin, Akwaeke Emezi, and Ocean Vuong. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Murphy\n\nHum/En 28\n\n##  Telling Time in American Modernism\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis course will explore modernist literature's relationship to time. We will\nidentify the methods that modernist narratives use to characterize the\nexperience of lived time, or temporality, such as stream of consciousness,\nnon-linear storytelling, and narrative omissions. We will ask: what challenges\ndoes temporal experience pose to clock time and, more broadly, historical\ntime? The course will emphasize the influence of new technologies on modernist\nrepresentations of time and space, including rural and urban space, and\nmodernism's engagement with changing attitudes regarding race, gender and\nsexuality. Students will learn about key movements within American modernism,\nincluding the Harlem Renaissance, and may opt to analyze modernist\nliterature's relationships to other genres, including music and visual\nculture.\n\nInstructor: Sherazi\n\nHum/En 29\n\n##  Dream Narratives\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nDream narratives reveal as much about cultural beliefs and superstitions as\nthey do about techniques of narration and interpretation. This course\ninvestigates key developments in the literature on dreams and dream\ninterpretations with examples drawn from the Renaissance through the beginning\nof the nineteenth century. Selected readings from Boccaccio, Descartes,\nCalder\u00f3n, Shakespeare, and Diderot, among others. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nHum/En 30\n\n##  Reading Animals\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nIn this course we will look closely at representations of nonhuman animals in\nliterature from the Middle Ages to our present moment as opportunities to\nrevisit definitions of, and the boundaries created and blurred between, the\n\"human\" and the \"animal.\" Readings may include Marie de France, Marianne\nMoore, Franz Kafka, Donna Haraway, Donika Kelly, and K-Ming Chang. Not offered\n2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Hill\n\nHum/En 31\n\n##  Introduction to Black Literature and Culture in the United States\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis introductory humanities course is for anyone who wishes to celebrate,\nstudy, and pass on Black expressive culture to the next generation.\nAltogether, the course will be an in-depth introduction to the study of Black\nintersectional identities and lived experiences across the United States. Our\ntexts will be comprised of a variety of artistic, cultural, and literary works\nin the US created since before its founding up until today. In addition to\nreading several literary texts, students will have the opportunity to learn\nabout several works of cultural expression that have become beloved\ntouchstones in Black history. Students will also read and apply several\ncritical contexts and methodologies for the study of Black literature and\nculture and will regularly document their own goals for furthering this body\nof work for future scholars. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Murphy\n\nHum/En 33\n\n##  Modern Metamorphoses\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nNarratives of metamorphosis have traditionally used their dramatic subject\nmatter-a radical change of form-as a vehicle for social criticism. This course\nexplores the ways in which twentieth-century writers experiment with the\nconcept of metamorphosis to take on the most pressing political and social\nissues of their day, including slavery, women's rights, and critiques of\ncapitalist excess. Readings to include Kafka, Garnett, Orwell, Tawada, and\nErpenbeck. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nHum/En 34\n\n##  Literature and Deception\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nIn this course, we will be considering lying and other types of deception from\nthe point of view of literature and philosophy, with two main goals in mind:\n1) to compare cultural practices of deception at various times in European\nhistory and 2) to think in general terms about the ability of a literary text\nto convey truth and falsehood. Can a fictional text be \"true\" in any\nmeaningful sense, such as a political one? Or, as many people have thought\nover time, is it more accurate to think about literature as a beautiful lie?\nReadings will include the legend of Till Eulenspiegel as well as texts by\nMachiavelli, Shakespeare, Diderot, and those relating to the Ossian\ncontroversy. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nHum/En 35\n\n##  Beginning with Poems\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first, second terms\n\nWhy begin the study of literature with poems? Written words are the building\nblocks of literature, and poetry, in Coleridge's famous equation, is \"the best\nwords in the best order.\" To be understood and appreciated, poetry requires a\nclose attention to words and their ordering as they are read and reread. All\ngood literature requires such attention, but practically speaking, poetry\nprovides the best way to acquire the art of rereading because of its shorter\nforms. More importantly, poetry can be the most emotionally intense and\nsatisfying of literary forms. We will read a small number of poems written in\nEnglish from the sixteenth to the twenty-first centuries from several genres -\nsonnet, ode, elegy, verse epistle, satire, villanelle - and on several\nsubjects - love, death, and politics. Poets will include William Shakespeare,\nEmily Dickinson, and Louise Gluck. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Pigman\n\nHum/En 36\n\n##  American Literature and Culture\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nStudies of American aesthetics, genres, and ideas from the birth of the nation\nto the present. Students will be introduced to the techniques of formal\nanalysis. We will consider what constitutes evidence in relation to texts and\nhow to develop a persuasive interpretation. Topics may include Nature's\nNation, slavery and its aftermath, individualism and the marketplace, the \"New\nWoman,\" and the relation between word and image.\n\nInstructor: Weinstein\n\nHum/En 37\n\n##  Welcome to Dystopia\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first\n\nThis course surveys a number of literary destinations you would never want to\nvisit in real life: places with near-unsurmountable political and\nenvironmental threats where individuality is crushed and where happy endings\nare hard to come by. Given that life in a dystopia is so awful, what makes\nthis genre of fiction so popular? And what can fictional dystopian societies\nteach us about our own? We will look for answers to these questions in the\nwork of some of the greatest writers of the past century, including Franz\nKafka, Shirley Jackson, Philip K. Dick, Cormac McCarthy, and Ursula K. Le\nGuin, among others.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nEn/Wr 83\n\n##  Personal Narrative and STEM Research\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course focuses on personal narrative and memoir writing by STEM\nresearchers. STEM research strives for objectivity and replicability, and key\ngenres of STEM research writing require that writers repress their\nsubjectivity and individuality. However, a researcher's experience of inquiry\nis often deeply personal and emotional, and some researchers choose to write\nabout those experiences in personal essays and memoirs. We will analyze a wide\nvariety of this narrative writing, and we will examine connections between the\nnarratives' formal features and the rhetorical effects they might have on\nreaders. Drawing on what we learn, students will compose an excerpt of their\nown memoir or a stand-alone personal narrative essay. The course will also\nexplore current approaches to spoken storytelling sometimes utilized by\nresearchers, such as the Moth story and the TED talk. Satisfies the Institute\nscientific writing requirement and oral communications requirements for\nstudents in all options.\n\nInstructor: Hall\n\nEn/Wr 84\n\n##  Communicating Science to Non-Experts\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course offers instruction in writing and speaking about science and\ntechnology for non-expert audiences. Instruction focuses on how to convey\ncomplex technical information in clear, engaging prose and speech in a variety\nof contexts. Readings in different genres (e.g., the newspaper discovery\nstory, the op-ed, the personal narrative, the explainer talk) raise issues for\ndiscussion and serve as models for assignments in these genres. The workshop-\nstyle nature of this course relies on drafting and revision in response to\npeer and instructor feedback. Satisfies the Institute scientific writing\nrequirement and the option oral communications requirement for humanities\nmajors. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Hall\n\nEn 85\n\n##  Poetry Writing\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nWhen William Blake wrote \"to see a World in a Grain of Sand,\" he tapped into\npoetry's power to model the universe. For instance, once we set up a simile\nbetween \"world\" and \"grain of sand\", we can test this hypothesis of sameness.\nHow is sand like the world? Where will the model fail? And what might that\ntell us? Imagery, sensory language, arguments, ideas, and verse form itself\ncan lead poetry toward power and discovery. This pursuit can reach from the\npage into one's own life. We will work hard together on poems, our own and one\nanother's. With permission of the instructor students may repeat the course\nfor credit. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Brown\n\nEn 86\n\n##  Fiction Writing\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThe class is conducted as a workshop of fiction writing. Contemporary short\nstories and novel excerpts are discussed, as well as the art and craft of\nwriting well. The course covers the essential elements of fiction writing,\nincluding character, voice, setting, world building, scene, summary, plot, and\ndialogue. Each week, we discuss a particular craft element, analyze published\nfiction, and provide feedback on student writing. Near the end of the course,\nstudents critique the work of their peers in small-group workshops.\n\nInstructor: Lepucki\n\nEn 87\n\n##  Creative Nonfiction\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first\n\nThis class is a seminar about the reading and writing of creative nonfiction.\nContemporary personal essays, profiles of public figures, and other examples\nof this vibrant form will be read and discussed, as well as the art and craft\nof writing well. The course covers the essential elements of the genre such as\ncharacterization, dramatization, voice, and the ethics of writing about real\nlife. Each week, we will analyze published nonfiction and practice writing\nwith in-class prompts; out of class, students will complete short exercises\nfor feedback. Near the end of the course, students will turn in one long piece\nof creative nonfiction (10-15 pages) to showcase what they've learned.\n\nInstructor: Lepucki\n\nEn 89\n\n##  Journalism and Storytelling\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nToday's political and social turmoil have cast a sometimes harsh light on news\nmedia and the journalistic writing approach. Is the media fulfilling its role\nin our democracy? What should it be? And what approach should journalists take\nin their reporting and writing? This course will ponder these questions as it\nexplores how to construct interesting, relevant, journalistic storytelling,\nincluding the use of new media tools. It will emphasize the foundations of the\ncraft, such as close attention to fact, accuracy, clarity and precision, and\nexamine its critical components, such as story form, reporting and\ninterviewing, theme and scene, and character development. It will offer\nopportunities to construct a long-form journalistic piece. Students will\nproduce numerous stories and other writing during the class, including\nprofiles, issues, analysis and reviews. Several of these will be offered for\npublication in The California Tech. There will be class visits by professional\njournalists and a possible off-campus excursion.\n\nInstructor: Kipling\n\nEn 98\n\n##  Reading in English\n\n9 units (1-0-8)\n\nPrerequisites: instructor's permission.\n\nAn individual program of directed reading in English or American literature,\nin areas not covered by regular courses. En 98 is intended primarily for\nEnglish majors and minors. Interested students should confer with an English\nfaculty member and agree upon a topic before registering for the course.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nEn 99 ab\n\n##  Senior Tutorial for English Majors\n\n9 units (1-0-8)\n\nStudents will study research methods and write a research paper. Required of\nstudents in the English option.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nEn 100\n\n##  Artificial Life: Literary Automata\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nWell before the advent of the Machine Age, literary texts have been populated\nby various kinds of ingenious automata, often in animal or human form. This\ncourse surveys the role of the automaton in literary texts in order to\nconsider how the notion of \"artificial life\" changes over time, with a focus\non the special case of the human machine. Readings from the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries to include texts by la Mettrie, Hoffmann, Kleist,\nShelley, Poe, and de l'Isle-Adam. We will conclude with a classic text from\nthe twentieth century: Isaac Asimov's _I, Robot._\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nEn 101\n\n##  Recalling the Wild\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nCity-dwellers invented the concept of wilderness, as a space apart from human\nlaws and culture. This course takes a critical look at the different values\nattributed to that space as it has been colonized by the human imagination.\nOur discussions will focus on the emergence of the perception of wilderness in\nEuropean literature in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but we\nconclude with the question: what meaning do we invest the concept of\n\"wilderness\" with today? Readings will include works by Buffon, Toqueville,\nChateaubriand, Byron, Thoreau, Wells, and London.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nEn 103\n\n##  Introduction to Medieval British Literature\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis course offers a tour of major (as well as some minor) genres and works\nwritten in Britain prior to 1500. Far from a literary \"dark age,\" the Middle\nAges fostered dramatic experiments in narrative form, bequeathing to modern\nliterature some of its best-loved genres and texts. We will practice reading\nin Middle English-the language of Chaucer and his contemporaries-while we\nconcentrate on the following questions: how did these texts circulate among\nreaders? How do they establish their authority? What kinds of historical and\ncultural currents to they engage? Texts may include the lives of saints, the\nconfessions of sinners, drama, lyrics, romances, selections from Chaucer's\nCanterbury Tales, and Malory's Morte Darthur. Readings will be in Middle and\nmodern English. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nEn 106\n\n##  Poetry and the Project of Justice\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course explores how contemporary poets grapple with the most urgent\nquestions of our moment: identity, equality, environmental crisis, and\njustice. In this class, students will gain confidence in reading, discussing,\nand writing about contemporary poems and will encounter recent and more\ndistant traditions of protest poetry. We will ask how poetic language\narticulates questions of embodiment, community, law, and memory. The syllabus\nwill focus in particular on writers of color, including queer and indigenous\npoets, and will include opportunities to attend local poetry readings. Not\noffered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Jahner\n\nEn 107\n\n##  Medieval Romance\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThe medieval term romanz designated both a language, French, and a genre,\nromance, dedicated to the adventures of knights and ladies and the villains,\nmonsters, magic, and miles that stood in their way. This course explores key\nexamples from the twelfth through the fifteenth centuries, while also\nexamining evolutions in the form. We will consider how romances figured love\nand desire as well as negotiated questions of law, territory, and cultural\ndifference. Authors and texts may include Chretien de Troyes, Marie de France,\nGawain and the Green Knight, Arthurian legends, outlaw tales, and hagiography.\nNot offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Jahner\n\nEn 109\n\n##  Madness and Reason\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nMadness threatens to dissolve boundaries of the most various kinds: between\nthe human and the inhumane, reality and fantasy, sickness and health. One of\nthe tasks of a literary text is to subdue and contain madness through the\nconstruction of rational frameworks. How does a literary text accomplish this?\nWhich strategies, such as the use of irony and humor, are the most effective?\nWhat role do insane characters play in literary texts? And when - if ever -\nshould we consider an excess of reason as a kind of madness in its own right?\nSelected readings from Shakespeare, Voltaire, Goethe, Hoffmann, B\u00fcchner,\nGogol, and Schnitzler, among others. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nEn/VC 110\n\n##  Sinners, Saints, and Sexuality in Premodern Literature\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis class explores the history of sexuality and gender across the Middle Ages\nand Renaissance. Exploring both literary texts and visual representation, it\nconsiders how previous eras and cultures understood embodiment, sexuality, and\ngender and asks how we, as modern readers and viewers, approach these\nquestions across the distance of centuries. We will read across a wide range\nof literature, including theology, philosophy, fiction, romance, and spiritual\nbiography, and examine manuscript illustrations and other early visual media.\nQuestions we will take up include the following: how did writers and artists\nconstruct the \"naturalness\" or \"unnaturalness\" of particular bodies and bodily\nacts? How did individuals understand the relationship between their own bodies\nand those of others? In what ways did writing and art authorize, scrutinize,\nor otherwise parse the boundaries of the licit and illicit? Finally, how have\nmodern critics framed these questions? How do we approach and make use of\nearlier theories of sex and gender?\n\nInstructor: Jahner\n\nEn 112\n\n##  Nineteenth-Century American Poetry\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nIn the 1855 edition of Leaves of Grass, Walt Whitman claimed that \"the United\nStates themselves are essentially the greatest poem.\" We might ask any number\nof questions in response to Whitman. If the United States are a poem, then who\nwrote it? What is this poem about? What genre is it? Is anyone reading it? Is\nit actually any good? Though we might approach Whitman's statement with some\napprehension from our historical moment, this course will take seriously\nAmerican life lived within poetry and the lives poems lived across the\ncountry. Together, we will track the development of American poetry as it\nengages with enslavement, abolition, genocide, war, beauty, nature,\nracialization, constructions of gender, sexuality, and affect. Ultimately, we\nwill ask what reading nineteenth-century American poetry, or nineteenth-\ncentury America as a poem, might mean for our understanding of the country\ntoday. Readings may include Bryant, Poe, Longfellow, Schoolcraft\n(Bamewawagezhikaquay), Whitman, Dickinson, Harper, Dunbar, and Noguchi. Not\noffered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Hill\n\nEn 113\n\n##  Shakespeare's Career: Comedies and Histories\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThe first of a two-course sequence on Shakespeare's career as a dramatist and\npoet. We will read plays from the first half of Shakespeare's career, his\ncomedies and histories. Particular attention will be paid to Shakespeare's use\nof his sources and to the textual history of the plays. En 113 and En 114 may\nbe taken independently and, usually, are given in alternate years. Not offered\n2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Pigman\n\nEn 114\n\n##  Shakespeare's Career: Tragedies and Tragicomedies\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThe second of a two-course sequence on Shakespeare's career as a dramatist and\npoet. We will read works from the second half of Shakespeare's career, his\ntragedies, tragicomedies, and Sonnets. Particular attention will be paid to\nShakespeare's use of his sources and to the textual history of the plays. En\n113 and En 114 may be taken independently and, usually, are given in alternate\nyears. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Pigman\n\nEn 115\n\n##  The Women of Ancient Epic\n\n(3-0-6) | second term\n\nEpic remains the most ancient and most modern of literary genres. Women in\nancient epic begin as prizes of honor for male warriors and become powerful\nwitches and queens, while some contemporary women writers allow their ancient\nheroines to speak in their own voices. From Homer to the present, epic\nnarratives also traverse continents as they narrate the founding and\nfoundering of empires historical and imaginary. This course introduces\nstudents to key classical epics while exploring historical and contemporary\nadaptations from Dante's _Divine Comedy_ to Madeline Miller's _Circe_ . By\nexamining the afterlives of epic, we will consider how the genre changes when\ntaken up by the gender typically marginalized in the classical tradition.\nPossible authors include Homer, Apollonius of Rhodes, Virgil, Ovid, Dante,\nChrista Wolf, Ursula K. Le Guin, Madeline Miller, and Mar\u00eda Baranda. Not\noffered 2024-25.\n\nInstructors: Jahner, Pigman\n\nEn/VC 116\n\n##  Picturing the Universe\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nWhether you are a physicist, photographer, or bibliophile, grab a warm jacket.\nThe night sky beckons. In addition to observing and photographing our own\nstarry skies, we will study 19thcentury literary, artistic, and scientific\nresponses to new understandings of the universe as dynamic, decentered, and\nlimitless. In Victorian England, picturing the universe in literature and\nrecording celestial light in photographs defied the physiological limitations\nof human observation and fueled larger debates about objective evidence and\nsubjective documentation. Prerequisites: students are required to take two\nFirst-Year Humanities classes before enrolling in Advanced Humanities.\n\nInstructor: Sullivan\n\nEn/VC 117\n\n##  The New York School of Poets\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nStarting in the early 1950s, the New York School of poets challenged the\nstuffy orthodoxy of mid-century American poetry by adopting the experimental\ntactics of European avant-garde movements such as Dadaism and Surrealism. This\ncourse offers a critical exploration of this influential group's varied body\nof work, with special attention to its extensive connections to the visual\narts. Throughout the course, we will think about the New York School's\nactivities in the context of Cold War American culture, emergent forms of\nqueer sociality, and the rapidly changing urban environment of postwar\nManhattan. Writers and artists covered may include Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery,\nAmiri Baraka, Kenneth Koch, Barbara Guest, James Schuyler, Joe Brainard, Alice\nNotley, Ted Berrigan, and Eileen Myles.\n\nInstructor: Schneiderman\n\nEn 118\n\n##  Mythology\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nWhy did the Greeks and Romans remain fascinated with the same stories of gods\nand heroes for more than a thousand years? On the other hand, how did they\nadapt old stories to fit new times and places? Our aim is to explore the\nhistory of classical poetry as a history of reading even older classical\npoetry. The course is also an excellent introduction to ancient literature in\ngeneral. Readings might include Homer's 'Odyssey,' Aeschylus, Sophocles,\nEuripides, Ovid, and Seneca.\n\nInstructor: Haugen\n\nEn 119\n\n##  Displacement\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis class combines the theme of geographic change, including migration and\nimmigration, with two literary questions. Why do novels of migration so often\nfocus on a strongly marked central character? And why is that character so\noften lonely or isolated? Past readings have included Chinua Achebe's 'Things\nFall Apart' (1959), Ottessa Moshfegh's 'My Year of Rest and Relaxation'\n(2018), and Charles Yu's 'Interior Chinatown' (2020). Those familiar with\nthese novels will notice that, in our class, migration may mean international\nuprooting or some other profound change closer to home.\n\nInstructor: Haugen\n\nEn 120\n\n##  What Women Want: Desire and the Modern American Novel\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThe question of what a woman wants animates a central strain of the modern\nAmerican novel, as do evolving ideas about what women can and cannot have.\nThis course considers female desire-for personal agency and freedom, self- and\nsexual fulfillment, economic and social opportunity-across a half dozen novels\nwritten from about 1880 - 1940, in light of some of the cultural forces that\nshape and constrain characters' (and real women's) horizons. Authors covered\nmay include Henry James, Edith Wharton, Theodore Dreiser, Anzia Yezierska,\nNella Larsen, and Zora Neale Hurston.\n\nInstructor: Jurca\n\nEn 121\n\n##  Early Novels\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nBefore modern media, novels had to stand in for every type of sequential\nentertainment: television, movies, and even hyperlinked web pages. The stories\nwe read in this class, dating from ancient Greece to the 1600s, are long,\nflorid, fantastic, and crammed with characters. What do these books reveal\nabout the values and interests of people in the past? Readings may include\nHeliodorus, Lodovico Ariosto, and John Bunyan. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Haugen\n\nEn 123\n\n##  The 19th-Century English Novel\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nA survey of the 19th-century novel from Austen through Conrad, with special\nemphasis upon the Victorians.

Major authors may include Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron,\nKeats, Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley, and Austen. Particular attention will be\npaid to intellectual and historical contexts and to new understandings of the\nrole of literature in society. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Gilmartin\n\nEn 126\n\n##  Gothic Fiction\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThe literature of horror, fantasy, and the supernatural, from the late 18th\ncentury to the present day. Particular attention will be paid to gothic's\nshifting cultural imperative, from its origins as a qualified reaction to\nEnlightenment rationalism, to the contemporary ghost story as an instrument of\nsocial and psychological exploration. Issues will include atmosphere and the\ngothic sense of space; gothic as a popular pathology; and the gendering of\ngothic narrative. Fiction by Walpole, Shelley, Bront\u00eb, Stoker, Poe, Wilde,\nAngela Carter, and Toni Morrison. Film versions of the gothic may be included.\nNot offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Gilmartin\n\nEn 127\n\n##  Jane Austen\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course will focus on the major novels of Jane Austen: Northanger Abbey,\nSense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, and\nPersuasion. Film and television adaptations will also be considered, and\nstudents may have the opportunity to read Austen's unfinished works, as well\nas related eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British fiction and non-fiction.\nNot offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Gilmartin\n\nEn 128\n\n##  Modern and Contemporary Irish Literature\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThe development of Irish fiction, poetry, and drama from the early 20th-\ncentury Irish literary renaissance, through the impact of modernism, to the\nField Day movement and other contemporary developments. Topics may include the\nimpact of political violence and national division upon the literary\nimagination; the use of folk and fairy-tale traditions; patterns of emigration\nand literary exile; the challenge of the English language and the relation of\nIrish writing to British literary tradition; and recent treatments of Irish\nliterature in regional, postcolonial, and global terms. Works by Joyce, Yeats,\nSynge, Friel, O'Brien, Heaney, Boland, and others. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Gilmartin\n\nEn/VC 129\n\n##  Literature/Photography/Facticity\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\n\"It is the picture of life contrasted with the fact of life, the ideal\ncontrasted with the real, which makes criticism possible,\" insists Frederick\nDouglass. This course will take an historical approach to the relationship\nbetween literature and photography by examining what Douglass refers to as the\ncontrast between \"picture\" and \"fact\" from the advent of photography in the\nnineteenth century to our present moment. Together, we will think about how\neach medium creates images, invites different ways of reading or viewing, and\nmakes forms of individual, collective, and political representation possible.\nWe will also examine the ways in which photography and literature shape our\nunderstanding of temporality, truth, memory, and history. In addition to our\nexperience of literary and photographic works, theoretical texts on\nphotography will inform the ways of reading and ways of seeing we will develop\nin this course. Readings may include Boucicault, Douglass, Dunbar, Hartmann,\nBarthes, Lorde, and Rankine. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nEn 131\n\n##  Poe's Afterlife\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course focuses on Edgar Allan Poe and the considerable influence his\nworks have had on other writers. Authors as diverse as Charles Baudelaire,\nJules Verne, Jorge Luis Borges, Vladimir Nabokov, John Barth, and Philip Roth\nhave used Poe's stories as departure points for their own work. We shall begin\nby reading some of Poe's s classic short stories, including \"The Narrative of\nArthur Gordon Pym,\" \"The Purloined Letter,\" and others. We shall then explore\nhow and why Poe's stories have been so important for authors, despite the fact\nthat his reputation as a great American writer, unlike Hawthorne's and\nMelville's, for example, is a relatively recent phenomenon.\n\nInstructor: Weinstein\n\nEn 132\n\n##  After Austen: Nineteenth-Century British Women's Writing\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThe Victorian period introduced a huge array of new possibilities and\nconstraints for women of all classes, as it witnessed rapid urbanization and\nindustrialization, a changing conception of marriage and motherhood, and a new\nset of professional restrictions but also opportunities. This class focuses on\nnovels by and about women, as it seeks to take the measure of these\ntransformations and of a larger culture's reaction to them. How did women\nimagine and re-imagine themselves and what they wanted? How did notions of\nfemininity and masculinity change? How do the imaginings of the Victorians\nresonate now? Authors studied may include Eliot, Gaskell, the Brontes,\nOliphant, Braddon, and Scheiner.\n\nInstructor: Gilmore\n\nEn 133\n\n##  Paradise Lost\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nWe will spend the term studying the famous and eccentric epic poem 'Paradise\nLost' (1674) by the British poet and politician John Milton. Each week we will\nread about 1,000 to 1,500 lines of difficult but beautiful poetry, looking\nespecially for its visual images, literary and mythological references, and\npoetic sounds, as well as Milton's copious and paradoxical philosophical\nstances. You will never forget the central character of Satan, the parliament\nof devils in Hell, the theological conversations in Heaven between God and\nJesus, Eve being tempted by diabolical arguments to eat the forbidden fruit,\nand Adam and Eve being driven from the Garden of Eden at the point of an\navenging angel's sword. Not offered 2024-25\n\nInstructor: Haugen\n\nEn 134\n\n##  The Career of Herman Melville\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThe course will analyze Melville's career starting with Typee and ending with\nBilly Budd. Special attention will be given to Moby-Dick and Pierre. The\ncentrality of Melville's position in American literature will be considered\nfrom a variety of perspectives, including aesthetics, representations of race,\nclass, and gender, the role of the audience, and connections with other\nauthors.\n\nInstructor: Weinstein\n\nEn/VC 135\n\n##  Dickens's London\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nCharles Dickens and London have perhaps the most famous relationship of any\nwriter and city in English. In this course, we will investigate both the\nLondon Dickens knew, and the portrait of the city that he painted, by reading\none of Dickens's great mid-career novels alongside a selection of contemporary\ntexts and images and secondary historical sources. We will think about the\ngap-or overlap- between history and fiction, the idea of the novelist as\nalternative historian, and the idea of the novel as historical document.\nHistorical topics covered may include: the development of the Victorian police\nforce; plague and public health; Victorian poverty; colonialism and\nimperialism; Dickens and his illustrators; Victorian exhibition and museum\nculture; and marriage and the cult of domesticity, among others. Students will\npractice both textual and visual analysis skills. In addition to written work,\nstudents should expect to be responsible for making a short research\npresentation at some point in the term. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Gilmore\n\nEn 136\n\n##  The Fiction of Charles Dickens\n\n9 units (3-0-6)\n\nAn overview of the Great Inimitable's fiction, concentrating on four texts\nrepresentative of different phases of his novel-writing career and their\nrelationship to the changing world of Victorian Britain: Oliver Twist, Dombey\nand Son, Bleak House, Our Mutual Friend. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nEn 137\n\n##  African American Literature\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course analyzes some of the great works of American literature written by\nAfrican Americans. This body of writing gives rise to two crucial questions:\nHow does African American literature constitute a literary tradition of its\nown? How is that tradition inextricable from American literary history? From\nslave narratives to Toni Morrison's Beloved, from the Harlem Renaissance to\nAlice Walker, from Ralph Ellison to Walter Mosley, African American literature\nhas examined topics as diverse and important as race relations, class\nidentification, and family life. We shall analyze these texts not only in\nrelation to these cultural issues, but also in terms of their aesthetic and\nformal contributions. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nEn 138\n\n##  Twain and His Contemporaries\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course will study the divergent theories of realism that arose in the\nperiod after the Civil War and before World War I. Authors covered may include\nHowells, James, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Twain, Sarah Orne Jewett, Jacob\nRiis, Stephen Crane, and W. E. B. DuBois. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Weinstein\n\nEn 139\n\n##  Ancient Greek Epic Poetry\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nWe will start the term by reading Homer's 'Iliad' (possibly 8th century B.C.)\nfor two weeks. This is a disconnected, strange, and violent poem, which raises\nthe excellent question how it could become a widely revered classic down to\nour own time. To look for answers--answers that perhaps also apply to any\n\"classic\" book-- we will go on to study the acts of interpretation, revision,\nand recycling that made the 'Iliad' fresh and different, sometimes virtually\nunrecognizable, for each new generation of readers. We survey surprising\nancient Greek philosophical interpretations, a medieval romance by Geoffrey\nChaucer set in ancient Troy, a fake Scottish epic poem allegedly composed by\n\"Ossian,\" Chuck Palahniuk's novel 'Fight Club' (1996), and other works. My\nsuggestion for you will be that the 'Iliad' has remained alive for millennia\nonly through quasi-biological processes of mistranscription, mutation, and\nnonlinear evolution. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Haugen\n\nEn 140\n\n##  African American Expatriate Culture in Postwar Europe\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nIn the years following World War II, an unprecedented number of African\nAmerican writers and artists moved to Paris and Rome, many seeking greater\npersonal liberties and a refuge from racial discrimination at home. As we\nexplore literature, nonfiction, and visual culture created by African\nAmericans in postwar Europe, we will consider: how and why does the postwar\ncreative scene in Paris differ from that of Rome? We will analyze postwar\nAfrican American expatriate writing's unique and often critical perspectives\nregarding American society and culture and identify the literary strategies\nthat writers used to address the changing times, promote social justice, and\nadvance new narrative forms, often by crossing traditional boundaries of genre\nand nation. Authors and artists studied may include James Baldwin, Richard\nWright, Barbara Chase-Riboud, William Demby, Maya Angelou, and Ralph Ellison.\nNot offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Sherazi\n\nEn 141\n\n##  Science on Stage\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nScience is no stranger to performance. There is a long tradition of presenting\nscientific ideas on various stages, whether for audiences comprised of experts\nor for a curious public, and there is an equally long tradition of integrating\nscientific ideas into theatrical works. In this course, we will read several\nscientifically informed plays, with a focus on the twentieth century. We will\nexplore the ways in which scientific ideas shape the dialogue, plot, and\nstaging of theatrical works and how theater can cause us to consider\nscientific thought from a new perspective. Readings are likely to include The\nPhysicists (Durenmatt), Kopenhagen (Frayn), Arcadia (Stoppard), and Inherit\nthe Wind (Lawrence and Lee), among other examples, including contemporary\nworks. This course will also invite both scientists and playwrights into the\nclassroom in order to enrich classroom discussions. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nEn 142\n\n##  US literature before the Civil War\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThe course will focus on the literature - what F.O. Matthiessen called \"The\nAmerican Renaissance\" -- produced in the period leading up to the Civil War.\nWe will consider representations of gender, race, and class, as well as the\naesthetic sensibilities in works by the following: Frederick Douglass, Ralph\nWaldo Emerson, Harriet Jacobs, Herman Melville, Edgar Allan Poe, Harriet\nBeecher Stowe, and Henry David Thoreau. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Weinstein\n\nEn 149\n\n##  The Literature of Crisis\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nNovels, poetry, and memoirs often hinge on experiences of crisis. They can be\nindividual and/or general, historically particular and/or universal: a plane\ncrash; a war; a sudden death; a prolonged one. This course will examine\nrepresentations of crisis, with a specific focus on their narrative\nimplications. What are the temporal, spatial, and aesthetic effects of crisis?\nAuthors covered may include Joan Didion, Percival Everett, Allen Ginsberg, Tom\nMcCarthy, Toni Morrison, Kurt Vonnegut, Virginia Woolf, Elie Wiesel, Joy\nWilliams. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Weinstein\n\nEn 150\n\n##  Chaos and Literature\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nWe tend to think of literary texts as models of a stable poetic order, but\nmodern and postmodern writers conduct increasingly bold experiments to test\nthe contrary. This class explores how writers from the nineteenth century\nonward draw upon ancient and contemporary concepts of chaos to test out\nincreasingly sophisticated models of disorder though writing. Readings to\ninclude Lucretius, Serres, Calvino, Barth, Stoppard, and Kehlmann. Not offered\n2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nEn 151\n\n##  Keeping Time\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThe way in which humans perceive and record time has a discernable history,\nand literary texts offer us one of the best ways to study it, particularly in\ntimes of war and natural catastrophe. With a focus on 16th- through 18th-\ncentury European literature, we will examine various techniques of literary\ntime-keeping as they relate to topics such as, fame and mortality, as well as\nthe experience of time's slowness and acceleration. Readings will include\nselections from Baroque emblem books as well as texts by Montaigne, Milton,\nPepys, Defoe, and Rousseau. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nEn/VC 160 ab\n\n##  Classical Hollywood Cinema\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course introduces students to Hollywood films and filmmaking during the\nclassical period, from the coming of sound through the '50s. Students will\ndevelop the techniques and vocabulary appropriate to the distinct formal\nproperties of film. Topics include the rise and collapse of the studio system,\ntechnical transformations (sound, color, deep focus), genre (the musical, the\nmelodrama), cultural contexts (the Depression, World War II, the Cold War),\naudience responses, and the economic history of the film corporations. Terms\nmay be taken independently. Part a covers the period 1927-1940. Part b covers\n1941-1960. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Jurca\n\nEn/VC 161\n\n##  The New Hollywood\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course examines the post-classical era of Hollywood filmmaking with a\nfocus on the late 1960s through the 1970s, a period of significant formal and\nthematic experimentation. We will study American culture and politics as well\nas film in this era, as we consider the relation between broader social\ntransformations and the development of new narrative conventions and cinematic\ntechniques. We will pay particular attention to the changing film industry and\nits influence on this body of work. Films covered may include _Bonnie and\nClyde_ , _The Graduate_ , _The Godfather_ , _Taxi Driver_ , and _Jaws_ .\n\nInstructor: Jurca\n\nEn 163\n\n##  Octavia E. Butler and the Literature of Black Futures\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis advanced humanities course begins with a selection of Octavia E. Butler's\n(1947-2006) novels and short stories. Born here in Pasadena, CA, Butler's\nwriting explored issues such as chattel slavery, climate change, genetic\nengineering, pandemics, nuclear apocalypse, and post-apocalyptic life. She was\nattentive to Black and indigenous modes of care, healing, social justice, and\norganizing. We will pay special attention to Butler's critical and theoretical\ncontributions to the fields of Afrofuturism, Black studies, feminisms, gender\nand sexuality studies, and the environmental humanities by reading her works\nin conjunction with criticism and theory. In the second half of the seminar,\nwe will explore connections between Butler and the works of other\nAfrofuturists and Black science fiction writers today. Finally, we will\nexplore our own ideas for extending Butler's literature of Black futures\ntoday. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Murphy\n\nEn 164\n\n##  Contemporary Black Diasporic Literature and Culture\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nWhat is a Black diasporic analytic and how might it deepen our understandings\nof the cultural and literary significance of Black lives around the world? The\nexpressive genius of Black people across Black diasporas has resulted in an\nextensive tradition within and beyond English-speaking nations. This is an\nintensive advanced humanities reading course on Black diasporic literature and\nculture since the 1980s as well as the various histories that inform and shape\nthis body of work. Students will read several recent works of Black diasporic\nliterature and culture and criticism that have reshaped our understandings of\nfamily, gender, identity, labor, migration, nation, race, sexuality, and more.\nStudents will analyze several literary and cultural works and practice writing\ntheir own Black diasporic criticism and interpretive methodologies. Not\noffered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Murphy\n\nEn 165\n\n##  Black Feminist and Queer Literature and Thought\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nFor centuries, Black people, especially queer and trans women, and non-binary\nand queer folx, writing in Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, the United States,\nand more, have used literature to reimagine feminisms and queerness. In the\ndecades following the second-wave feminist movement, a body of writing\nnecessitated the creation of \"Black feminist criticism\" and \"queer of color\ncritique.\" It was a moment in which Black people across identities and\nnational origins wrote several works that radically retheorized family, home,\ngender, love, race, sexuality, work, and more, in ways that challenged\ncultures of violence in favor of imagining beloved communities. In this\nadvanced humanities course, students will read, discuss, and better understand\nmultiple literary and critical works participating in Black feminisms and\nBlack queer thought in order to theorize new possibilities for Black futures.\nNot offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Murphy\n\nEn/VC 172\n\n##  Heritage and Its Discontents\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nWhat makes an old building, artifact, or custom \"historic\"? Which historic\nthings are worth preserving? This course explores the aesthetic, political,\nsocial, and environmental dimensions of cultural heritage. We will examine the\nnarratives and values associated with heritage conservation at the local level\nas well as within national and global contexts. From Caltech's own campus and\nthe Watts Towers, to the national parks, UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and the\nculinary legacy of the Atlantic slave trade, our class will grapple with the\ntheories, practices, and debates as they determine what gets preserved and\nwhich stories get told. Readings/screenings will be supplemented with field\ntrips to heritage sites in Pasadena and Los Angeles.\n\nInstructor: Jurca\n\nEn 179\n\n##  Constituting Citizenship before the Fourteenth Amendment\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nWhat can a slave's narrative teach us about citizenship? How did the new\nnation identify citizens when its Constitution seemed so silent on the matter?\nAnd how did one tailor's pamphlet result in one of most massive restrictions\nof free speech in U.S. history? Our goal over the semester will be to sketch a\nstory of African American literary production from the latter half of the\neighteenth century to the Civil War and to tease out, through this literature,\ndeveloping understandings of citizenship in the United States. We will read\nletters, poems, sermons, songs, constitutions and bylaws, short stories, and\ntexts that simply defy easy categorization. We will also spend several\nsessions becoming familiar with key newspapers and magazines-Freedom's\nJournal, Frederick Douglass's Paper, The Anglo-African Magazine, Christian\nRecorder, and The Crisis-to deepen our understanding of the kinds of things\npeople were reading and writing on a regular basis and the kinds of arguments\nthey were making. Writers up for discussion may include: Frederick Douglass,\nJames Madison, Harriet Jacobs, Henry David Thoreau, Sojourner Truth, and David\nWalker. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nEn 180\n\n##  Special Topics in English\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | offered by announcement\n\nThis is an advanced humanities course on a specialized topic in English. It is\nusually taught by new or visiting faculty. The course may be re-taken for\ncredit except as noted in the course announcement. Limited to 15 students. See\nregistrar's announcement for details.\n\nInstructors: Staff, visitor\n\nEn 181\n\n##  Hardy: The Wessex Novels\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course will examine the body of work that the late Victorian novelist\nThomas Hardy published under the general title The Wessex Novels, that is, the\nsequence of works from Far from the Madding Crowd to Jude the Obscure. The six\nmain novels will be read critically to give a sense of the totality of this\ngreatest British regional novelist's achievement. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nEn 183\n\n##  Victorian Crime Fiction\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nIn 19th-century Britain, for the first time in human history, more of a\nnation's citizens came to live in urban areas than in rural ones. This result\nof the Industrial Revolution produced many effects, but in the fiction of the\nperiod, one of the most striking was an obsession with the problem of crime.\nVictorian authors filled their novels with murder, prisons, poisonings,\nprostitution, criminals, and the new figure of the detective; in this class we\nwill look at the social history, publishing developments, and formal dilemmas\nthat underlay such a response. Authors studied may include Dickens, Collins,\nBraddon, Conan Doyle, Chesterton, and Conrad, among others. Not offered\n2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Gilmore\n\nEn 185\n\n##  Dickens and the Dickensian\n\n9 units (3-0-6)\n\nThe adjective \"Dickensian\" makes an almost daily appearance in today's\nnewspapers, magazines, and other media sources. It is used to describe\neverything from outrageous political scandals, to Bollywood musicals, to\nmultiplot novels. But what does the word really mean? And what part of Charles\nDickens's output does it refer to? This class will consider some of Dickens's\nmost famous works alongside a series of contemporary novels, all critically\ndescribed in \"Dickensian\" terms. The main concern will be equally with style\nand form, and 19th-century and present-day circumstances of production (e.g.,\nserialization, mass production, Web publication, etc.). Authors considered\n(aside from Dickens) may include Richard Price, Zadie Smith, Monica Ali, and\nJonathan Franzen. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nEn 186\n\n##  The Novel of Education\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis class takes up a set of mostly very funny, mostly 20th century British\nnovels to frame a simple-seeming, yet deceptively complicated set of\nquestions: What does it mean to be educated? Who has access to education? What\ndoes an ideal education consist in? And ultimately: What is a university for?\nAs we think through these questions we will read op/eds and investigative\njournalism in addition to fiction, and we will consider a variety of\nuniversity-centered topics (determined by student interest) including issues\nof gender, class, privilege, race, and genius. Authors read may include\nSayers, Larkin, Amis, C.P. Snow, Lodge, and Zadie Smith. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Gilmore\n\nEn 190\n\n##  Chaucer\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis course devotes itself to the writings of the diplomat, courtier,\nbureaucrat, and poet, Geoffrey Chaucer. Best known for the Canterbury Tales,\nChaucer also authored dream visions, lyrics, and philosophical meditations.\nThis course will introduce you to some better-known and lesser-known works in\nthe Chaucerian corpus, while also exploring questions central to the\nproduction and circulation of literature in the fourteenth and fifteenth\ncenturies. What did it mean to \"invent\" a literary work in late medieval\nEngland? How did Chaucer imagine himself as a writer and reader? What are the\nhallmarks of Chaucerian style, and how did Chaucer become the canonical author\nhe is today?

Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Brown\n\nHum/H 11\n\n##  Love and Death: Using Demography to Study the History of Europe from 1700\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first, third terms\n\nDemographic events-births, marriages, deaths-have always been highly\nresponsive to changes in the local environment. Decisions about when to marry,\nhow many children to have, or what kind of household to live in have always\nbeen closely correlated to decisions people take in other areas of their lives\nand, as a result, can tell us a great deal about the economic, social, and\ncultural worlds people inhabit. This course examines differences in\ndemographic trends in Europe across space and time, from 1700 to the present,\nas well as existing explanations for these differences, including political\neconomic factors, social and cultural norms, biology and disease environments.\nSome topics include: the demographic effects of war, industrialization, and\nurbanization; changes related to the emergence of reliable contraceptive\ntechnologies; changes related to the expansion of economic opportunities for\nwomen; the effects of government policies on demographic decisions. Not\noffered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Dennison\n\nHum/H 12\n\n##  Social Theory\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis course introduces students to both canonical and non-canonical theories\nof society. From the formative debates over the role of the state in human\naffairs in early modern Europe to radical interpretations of social good in\nthe twentieth century, students will be exposed to competing theories of\nsociety and their implications in the political, the economic, the emotional,\nand the scientific realms. By the end of the quarter, students will be able to\nlink contemporary notions of individuality, agency, rationality, morality, and\nethics to divergent discourses in the history of social theory. Not offered\n2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nHum/H 13\n\n##  Brave New Worlds: Race, Human Rights and the Age of Discovery\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course traces the origins of modern racism and, perhaps surprisingly, of\nhuman rights advocacy itself, to a seminal moment in global history sometimes\ncalled the Age of Discovery. At this time, two small European kingdoms, Spain\nand Portugal, first conducted trade and conquest in Atlantic Africa, the\nAmericas, and the Indian and Pacific Oceans, forging the world's first truly\nglobal empires. We study the legacy of racism and humanitarianism in eye-\nwitness accounts, maps, images and other materials attesting to Spain's\nseminal encounters with the Americas.\n\nInstructor: Wey-Gomez\n\nHum/H/HPS 14\n\n##  Race, Science, and Medicine in U.S. History\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course will explore how natural philosophers and scientists have defined,\nused, and sometimes challenged ideas about race from the eighteenth century to\ntoday. Using a range of primary and secondary sources, we will examine how\nscientific ideas about race developed in concert with European imperial\nexpansion and slavery; how these ideas were employed in legal cases, medical\npractice, and eugenics policies; and how activists and scholars have\nchallenged racist practices and ideas. Finally, we will turn to the recent\nresurgence of racial thinking in biology and medicine in the light of the\nhistory of race and science. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nHum/H/HPS 15\n\n##  Waste in the World\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second, third terms\n\nThe things that human beings make and throw away rarely stay where we put\nthem. Just as humans have shaped the biological and physical world, the\nbiological and physical world shapes human actions. In this course, we will\nexamine how these interacting forces propel environmental and cultural change.\nWe will explore these concepts through the lens of waste - how different\ngroups at different points in history define waste, where discarded things go\nand what they become as they move through space and time. We will consider how\nconflicting perceptions of utility and waste in different cultural and\nhistorical contexts have factored into shifting ideas about race, class,\ngender, wilderness, technology, consumption, and sovereignty. In rethinking\nwaste, we will explore the multiple meanings of \"nature,\" assess the roots of\nsustainability, and evaluate past events in light of current ideas about\nenvironmental justice. While this course prioritizes reading and discussion,\nwe will also engage with the world around us through visual analysis. Pasadena\nand Los Angeles will be among our most important resources, allowing us to\nground global ideas in a local context.\n\nInstructor: Rand\n\nHum/H/HPS 18\n\n##  Introduction to the History of Science\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second, third terms\n\nMajor topics include the following: What are the origins of modern Western\nscience, when did it emerge as distinct from philosophy and other cultural and\nintellectual productions, and what are its distinguishing features? When and\nhow did observation, experiment, quantification, and precision enter the\npractice of science? What were some of the major turning points in the history\nof science? What is the changing role of science and technology? Using primary\nand secondary sources, students will take up significant topics in the history\nof science, from ancient Greek science to the 20th-century revolution in\nphysics, biology, and technology. Hum/H/HPS 10 may be taken for credit toward\nthe additional 36-unit HSS requirement by HPS majors and minors who have\nalready fulfilled their first-year humanities requirement and counts as a\nhistory course in satisfying the first-year humanities breadth requirement.\n\nInstructor: Feingold\n\nHum/H 19\n\n##  Righting the Wrongs of History\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nIn recent years, growing numbers of people committed to equity and social\njustice have discussed various ways of addressing historical injustices whose\nharms are still experienced in the present. Some have proposed monetary\nrestitution and other restorative strategies that account for resources,\nopportunities, and lives lost. Others have advocated more symbolic reparative\napproaches that seek to heal the psychic wounds of injustice. This course will\nexamine efforts to right the wrongs of history, with particular attention\ngiven to the decades-long movement for reparations for African Americans and\nrecent efforts to address difficult histories at Caltech. Investigating\ninitiatives that have been realized and others that have been only imagined,\nin this course we will seek to understand both the possibilities and\nimpossibilities of repairing historical harms. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Wiggins\n\nHum/H/HPS 20\n\n##  COVID-19 and Other Pandemics: Science, Medicine, and Public Controversies\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course will analyze the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of other similar\nevents in the history of public health and medicine. How do we understand the\nCOVID pandemic and the differential responses to it around the globe? What is\nthe best framework for proper understanding? Science, history, politics,\nculture? Special attention will be given to the state of medical science today\nand in the past, the understanding of ethology, transmission, and symptoms;\nthe role of scientists, physicians, and \"quacks\"; the persistence and change\nin the forms of fear, superstition, and misinformation across time.\n\nInstructor: Kormos-Buchwald\n\nH 60\n\n##  Reading in History\n\nUnits to be determined for the individual by the division | any term\n\nReading in history and related subjects, done either in connection with the\nregular courses or independently, but under the direction of members of the\ndepartment.

Major artists,\nexhibitions, and writings of the period will be surveyed. While considering\nthis historical and critical context, students will create their own original\nnew media artworks using technologies and/or fabrication methods they choose.\nPossible approaches to projects may involve robotics, electronics, computer\nprogramming, computer graphics, mechanics and other technologies. Students\nwill be responsible for designing and fabricating their own projects. Topics\nmay include systems in art, the influence of industrialism, digital art,\nrobotics, telematics, media in performance, interactive installation art, and\ntechnology in public space. Artists studied may include Eadweard Muybridge,\nMarcel Duchamp, Vladmir Tatlin, John Cage, Jean Tinguely, Stelarc, Survival\nResearch Laboratories, Lynne Hershman Leeson, Edwardo Kac, Natalie\nJeremenjenko, Heath Bunting, Janet Cardiff and others.

This class looks at the visual and material culture produced by\nand consumed during encounters between European and Asian travelers,\ndiplomats, artists, writers, and tourists since the eighteenth century. Not\noffered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nH 107\n\n##  The Early Middle Ages\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course is designed to introduce students to the formative period of\nWestern medieval history, from roughly 300 to 1000 CE. It will emphasize the\ndevelopment of a new civilization from the fusion of Roman, Germanic, and\nChristian traditions, with a focus on the Frankish world. The course focuses\non the reading, analysis, and discussion of primary sources. Not offered\n2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Brown\n\nH 108\n\n##  The High Middle Ages\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course is designed to introduce students to European history between 1000\nand 1400. It will provide a topical as well as chronological examination of\nthe economic, social, political, and religious evolution of western Europe\nduring this period, with a focus on France, Italy, England, and Germany. The\ncourse emphasizes the reading, analysis, and discussion of primary sources.\nNot offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Brown\n\nH 109\n\n##  Medieval Knighthood\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course tells the story of the knight from his beginnings in the early\nMiddle Ages, through his zenith in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries, to his\ndecline and transformation in the late medieval and early modern periods. The\ncourse treats the knight not simply as a military phenomenon but also as a\nsocial, political, religious, and cultural figure who personified many of the\nelements that set the Middle Ages apart.\n\nInstructor: Brown\n\nH 110\n\n##  Environment and Empire in the Early Modern Atlantic World\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first\n\nAccording to earth scientists, European colonization of the Americas\nconstituted an ecological disaster of global proportions. The environmental\nimpact of colonization, however, was experienced at every scale as new people,\nanimals, plants, and microbes collided in unprecedented and unanticipated\nways. This course will explore all of these scales and introduce students to\nboth the field of environmental history and to the Atlantic World, a term used\nby scholars to describe interactions between Europeans, Africans, and\nAmericans from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century. The major themes of\nthis course will be the exploration and exploitation of the natural world by\nEuropeans, the creation of knowledge about the natural world, the use of\nenvironment as a tool of resistance by enslaved Africans and Indigenous\npeoples and changing views of the natural world throughout the early modern\nperiod.\n\nInstructor: Jones\n\nH 111\n\n##  The Medieval Church\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course takes students through the history of the medieval Christian\nChurch in Europe, from its roots in Roman Palestine, through the zenith of its\npower in the high Middle Ages, to its decline on the eve of the Reformation.\nThe course focuses on the church less as a religion (although it will by\nnecessity deal with some basic theology) than as an institution that came to\nhave an enormous political, social, cultural, and economic impact on medieval\nlife, and for a brief time made Rome once more the mistress of Europe.\n\nInstructor: Brown\n\nH 112\n\n##  The Vikings\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course will take on the Scandinavian seafaring warriors of the 8th-11th\ncenturies as a historical problem. What were the Vikings, where did they come\nfrom, and how they did they differ from the Scandinavian and north German\npirates and raiders who preceded them? Were they really the horned-helmeted,\nbloodthirsty barbarians depicted by modern popular media and by many medieval\nchronicles? What effect did they have in their roughly two centuries of\nraiding and colonization on the civilizations of medieval and ultimately\nmodern Europe? Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Brown\n\nH 123\n\n##  Ordinary People: Uncovering Everyday Life in the European Past\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nIn the historical record, much attention is given to wealthy elites (rulers\nand lawmakers, aristocrats, wealthy merchants), since they were the ones who\nleft written records of their political and economic activities and their\npersonal affairs. But what about the vast majority of people who lived in the\npast, most of whom were barely literate and had little opportunity to 'make\nhistory'? What can we know about them? This class focuses on the lives of\nordinary people, and the sources historians use to learn about them. Special\nattention will be given to women, the poor, and other marginalized groups in\nsocieties ranging from England in the west to Russia in the east. Not offered\n2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Dennison\n\nH 124\n\n##  Russia\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nCurrent events have us looking to the past for explanations. How does Russian\nhistory help us to understand what is happening in Russia today? Contemporary\npolitical commentary emphasizes the recent past: the history of the Soviet\nUnion and its collapse in 1991. This course takes a longer look at Russian\npolitical, economic, social, and cultural history - from imperial Russia to\nthe present day. The emphasis is on longer continuities over eras: tsarist,\nSoviet, post-Soviet. Topics covered include the nature and role of the state,\ninternal politics, rule of law and property rights, serfdom, inequality, art\nand social commentary, popular resistance, censorship, and the effects of all\nof these on the lives of ordinary Russians. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Dennison\n\nH 125\n\n##  Soviet Russia\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nWhy was the Russian Revolution of 1917 successful? And how did the Soviet\nsystem survive nearly 75 years? These questions will be addressed in the wider\ncontext of Russian history, with a focus on political, economic, and social\ninstitutions in the pre- and post-revolutionary period. Subjects covered\ninclude the ideological underpinnings of Bolshevism, Lenin and the Bolshevik\ncoup, the rise of Stalin, collectivization, socialist realism, the command\neconomy, World War II, the Krushchev 'thaw', dissident culture and the arts,\npopular culture, and Gorbachev's perestroika. A variety of sources will be\nused, including secondary historical literature, fiction, film, and art. Not\noffered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Dennison\n\nH/HPS 129\n\n##  History of Satellites: From Sputnik to Starlink\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThe artificial satellites encircling the planet make up a global information\ninfrastructure. Most of us living in industrialized regions use satellites\ndaily without even realizing it. How did satellites become so integral to\nterrestrial technological systems? How did Earth orbit transform from a\nwilderness into a landscape during the second half of the 20th century, and\nhow is that landscape changing in the 21st? We will trace the history of\nsatellites beginning with the first artificial \"moons\" and moving into the\ncurrent moment of private industry ascendance, taking into account the\ndevelopment, use, and decay of these technologies. We will consider how\ndesigners and users shape satellites, and map out the ways that objects in\norbit reflect and reinforce power and geopolitics on the ground below. Not\noffered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Rand\n\nH/HPS 130\n\n##  Critical Infrastructures\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nIn much of mainstream American culture an enthusiasm for innovation can\novershadow the older, established technologies that (often invisibly) sustain\nsociety. In this course, we will examine the interplay of environment,\ntechnology, and labor that shapes infrastructures and the acts of maintenance\nthat sustain these naturalized systems. We will explore the history and\npolitics of local and regional networks including but not limited to energy,\ntransportation, and information. This course includes site visits and\npresentations by campus infrastructure experts that help guide our critical\nencounters with the naturalized technological systems that support daily life\nand work at Caltech, and which both connect us to and separate us from the\nsurrounding region.\n\nInstructor: Rand\n\nH/HPS 131\n\n##  History of Extinction\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nHumans are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction-the first to be caused by\nhuman activity. Extinction has been viewed in changing ways over the past 200\nyears, and this course takes an interdisciplinary approach to learning about\nthe extinction process from a historical as well as a modern perspective. Our\nfocus will be on the extinction of biological entities, but we will also touch\non other systems that have disappeared: languages, technologies, habitats, and\nways of living. Central to our endeavors will be asking what it means to live\nin this time of loss: Should we mourn? And if so, how do we mourn for what\nmany or most of us do not see, but only read about? Finally, we will\nscrutinize what the practical effects of extinction have been, are, and will\nbe. We will also make at least one visit to a natural history museum to view\nsome extinct species behind the scenes.\n\nInstructor: Lewis\n\nH/HPS 132\n\n##  Humanistic Ecology\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nHumans' conceptions of nature have changed dramatically over time. Ecological\nsystems influence human culture, politics, law, and many other spheres, and in\nturn, humans influence those systems. This class introduces students to the\nfield of humanistic ecology-a discipline that looks to a number of cultural,\npolitical, historical and economic elements to better understand the role of\necology in a larger sphere outside of its scientific structure and uses.\nHumanistic ecology is designed to provide context for the study of ecology,\nand in a fundamental way, focuses on the appropriate role of humanity in its\nrelationship to nature: what is ethical, or not, what is useful, or not, and a\nvariety of other matters that should be considered when taking a fully three-\ndimensional view of ecological science. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Lewis\n\nH/HPS 133\n\n##  Forests and Humans\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nForests - which cover 31 percent of the world's land surface - have played\nessential roles in enhancing the planet's biodiversity. Forests have also\nserved humans in numerous and often controversial ways, and have also been\nsubjected to dramatic change through human activity. How well have we served\nforests, as well as being served by them? The class will cover the growth and\nuse of forests from a humanistic and historic perspective, as well as\ndiscussions about the role of fire in forests, with a particular emphasis on\nthe unprecedented forest fires in California in the past several years and the\nglobal ecological implications. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Lewis\n\nH/HPS 134\n\n##  Birds, Evolution, Speciation and Society\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThe cultural, scientific, social and political roles of birds make them an\nexcellent lens through which to view humans' interactions with the natural\nworld. This course will cover our changing understandings of birds, starting\nwith hawking and falconry in earlier centuries, through the discovery of new\nspecies, up through Darwinian understandings of speciation and evolution, and\ncontinuing up to present scientific understandings of birds' capabilities and\ntheir ties to humankind, as well as to other anchors in the natural world. We\nwill take a strong biographical as well as avian approach to understanding key\npersonalities who furthered our understandings of avian science.\n\nInstructor: Lewis\n\nH 136\n\n##  Caltech in the Archives\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis class will introduce students to the methods of archival work in the\nhumanities and social sciences. Over the course of the quarter students will\nreceive an introduction to factors surrounding the collection, organization,\nand use of various types of archives as a background to several small-scale\nprojects working in an archival collection of their own choosing. The seminar\nwill center around weekly projects and synthetic analytical essays about the\narchival process and archival discoveries. Students hoping to combine their\ncourse work with an archive-based research paper may sign up for a separate\nindependent study and conduct research concurrently, with instructor approval.\nNot offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nH 137\n\n##  Criminals, Outlaws, and Justice in a Thousand Years of Chinese History\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis course explores the shifting boundary between discourses of crime and\ndisobedience over the last millennium or so of Chinese history. It offers\nfictional, philosophical, political, propagandistic, official, and personal\nwritings on crime and those who commit it as a basis for a wide-ranging series\nof discussions about when breaking the law is good, when breaking the law is\nbad, and who gets to decide where the line between a criminal and an outlaw\nshould be drawn. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nH 138\n\n##  The Way\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis course introduces students to some of the seminal writings on the meaning\nof life, the essentials of rulership, and the place of the individual in the\nuniverse from the history of Chinese thought and philosophy. Students are\ngiven selected readings from several schools of thought in Chinese history,\nwith an emphasis on the formative Warring States era (the period of the\nHundred Schools of classical Chinese philosophy). Instead of being asked to\nwrite expository or argumentative essays, participants in this seminar will be\nintroduced to analyzing and presenting texts using the method of annotation.\nExposure to the principles of annotation will provide students with a new\napproach to analyzing and talking about texts both within a humanistic context\nand beyond. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nH 139\n\n##  Translation Theory and Practice (Chinese Historical Sources Seminar)\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis seminar will introduce students to the problems and practices of\nhistorical translation for academic purposes, with a focus on primary\nmaterials from Chinese history. Students will take responsibility for an\nindividual translation project, participate in seminar discussions and\ncollaborative projects to improve the translations being made, and discuss the\nphilosophical and methodological questions at the heart of the practice of\ntranslation. Advanced proficiency in written Chinese is required. Students who\nwrite analyses (4,000 words) of the sources being translated may enroll in\nthis class as H 139, which satisfies the advanced humanities credit. Not\noffered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nH/L 142\n\n##  Perspectives on History through Russian Literature\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThe Russian intelligentsia registered the arrival of modern urban society with\na highly articulate sensitivity, perhaps because these changes-\nindustrialization, the breakdown of traditional hierarchies and social bonds,\nthe questioning of traditional beliefs-came to Russia so suddenly. This gives\ntheir writings a paradigmatic quality; the modern dilemmas that still haunt us\nare made so eloquently explicit in them that they have served as models for\nsucceeding generations of writers and social critics. This course explores\nthese writings (in English translation) against the background of Russian\nsociety, focusing especially on particular works of Chekhov, Dostoevsky,\nGoncharov, Tolstoy, and Turgenev. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Dennison\n\nH 149\n\n##  Age of Fracture: America Since 1974\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nIn this course, we will examine America after Richard Nixon's resignation in\n1974, a period that historians have referred to as an age of fracture and\nsocial disaggregation. Using fracture as a conceptual framework to investigate\nAmerican politics and culture in the last quarter of the twentieth century,\nwe'll consider how the recent past has informed present-day American society.\nThemes of study will include the culture wars, political polarization,\nglobalization, and the growing wealth gap. In addition, we'll investigate the\ntheoretical and methodological challenges of doing recent history.\n\nInstructor: Wiggins\n\nH 152\n\n##  Where Do We Go from Here? Black America in the Post-Civil Rights Era\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis course will examine African American politics, culture, and society in\nthe decades following the passage of landmark civil rights legislation in the\n1960s. Topics of discussion will include deindustrialization and the rise of\nhip hop culture, black feminist and queer thought, debates over welfare and\naffirmative action, and mass incarceration. Analyzing a variety of political\nand cultural artifacts as well as cutting-edge secondary literature, we will\ninvestigate various moments in recent African American history to gain insight\ninto changing notions of rights, citizenship, equality, and freedom in\nAmerican society.\n\nInstructor: Wiggins\n\nH/HPS 153\n\n##  Inequality and Environment\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis seminar introduces students to the history of environmental inequality,\nenvironmental racism, and environmental justice. Human bodies are inescapably\nenmeshed in our environments: human health and environmental health are\ninseparable. But environmental burdens and benefits are distributed unevenly\nalong lines of race, gender, class, and nationality. We will examine local,\nnational, and transnational case studies to understand the historical\ndevelopment of environmental inequalities and movements for environmental\njustice. We will consider different methods for studying environmental\ninjustice and the politics of environmental knowledge. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nH/HPS 154\n\n##  Feminist Science Studies\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis seminar offers an introduction to scholarship on gender and science.\nFeminist science studies can seem oxymoronic: the objectivity on which science\ndepends appears opposed to the political commitments feminism implies.\nScholars in feminist science studies, however, argue that feminist theory and\nmethods can in fact improve scientific practice. This course will introduce\nstudents to the historical development of feminist Science & Technology\nStudies and what this field tells us about the history of women in science,\nthe history of scientific theories of sex/gender, and the future of feminist\nresearch. This reading-heavy class will also include discussions of feminist\nepistemology, feminist research methods, and new directions in feminist STS.\nNot offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nH/HPS 155\n\n##  Mortality Crises and Social Change: Epidemic Disease from 1300 to the\nPresent\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nWhat do we know about epidemics in the past? What did contemporaries\nunderstand about these events? How did societies respond to periodic bouts of\nepidemic disease? This course examines mortality crises and epidemics from the\nBlack Death in the 14th century to the current coronavirus pandemic, with\nattention given to the impact of epidemics on societies, the ways in which\nsuch outbreaks have been understood over time and the kinds of responses they\nhave elicited. We will draw on studies for a range of societies in order to\nidentify patterns across space and time, and to highlight both continuity and\nchange in the ways societies have dealt with contagious diseases. Not offered\n2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Dennison\n\nHPS/H 160\n\n##  Einstein on the Run: European Scientists Fleeing Fascism, War, and the\nHolocaust\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nStructured around the life and work of Albert Einstein (1879-1955), the course\nwill focus on the 1930s and 1940s, including the discovery of nuclear fission\nand the making of the atom bomb. Colleagues of Einstein, such as Max Born,\nHans Bethe, Enrico Fermi, Lise Meitner, Erwin Schrodinger, and untold numbers\nof students, scientists, and engineers were forced out of their universities\nand laboratories by the rise of Fascism in Europe and sought shelter in the\nUnited States and elsewhere. Many contributed to the Allied World War II\neffort. Einstein himself became a facilitator for immigrant scientists,\nintellectuals, and artists seeking refuge. We shall use historical documents\nfrom the Einstein Archives to understand the complex collective and individual\nexperiences and their impact on developments in science and technology during\nthis turbulent historical period.\n\nInstructor: Kormos-Buchwald\n\nH 161\n\n##  Selected Topics in History\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | offered by announcement\n\nThis is an advanced humanities course on a specialized topic in History.

Topics covered include the high-energy\nparticle laboratory as compared with a biological one; Western as compared to\nnon-Western scientific reasoning; the use of visualization techniques in\nscience from their inception to virtual reality; gender in science; and other\ntopics.\n\nInstructor: Feingold\n\nHPS/H 166\n\n##  Historical Perspectives on the Relations between Science and Religion\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThe course develops a framework for understanding the changing relations\nbetween science and religion in Western culture since antiquity. Focus will be\non the ways in which the conceptual, personal, and social boundaries between\nthe two domains have been reshaped over the centuries. Questions to be\naddressed include the extent to which a particular religious doctrine was more\nor less amenable to scientific work in a given period, how scientific activity\ncarved an autonomous domain, and the roles played by scientific activity in\nthe overall process of secularization.\n\nInstructor: Feingold\n\nHPS/H 167\n\n##  Experimenting with History/Historic Experiment\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nPrerequisites: Ph 1 abc, and Ph 2 abc (may be taken concurrently).\n\nThis course uses a combination of lectures with hands-on laboratory work to\nbring out the methods, techniques, and knowledge that were involved in\nbuilding and conducting historical experiments. We will connect our laboratory\nwork with the debates and claims made by the original discoverers, asking such\nquestions as how experimental facts have been connected to theories, how\nanomalies arise and are handled, and what sorts of conditions make\nhistorically for good data. Typical experiments might include investigations\nof refraction, laws of electric force, interference of polarized light,\nelectromagnetic induction, or resonating circuits and electric waves. We will\nreconstruct instrumentation and experimental apparatus based on a close\nreading of original sources. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Buchwald\n\nHPS/H 168\n\n##  History of Electromagnetism and Heat Science\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nPrerequisites: Ph 1 abc, and Ph 2 abc (may be taken concurrently).\n\nThis course covers the development of electromagnetism and thermal science\nfrom its beginnings in the early 18th century through the early 20th century.\nTopics covered include electrostatics, magnetostatics, electrodynamics,\nMaxwell's field theory, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and\nstatistical mechanics as well as related experimental discoveries.\n\nInstructor: Buchwald\n\nHPS/H 169\n\n##  Selected Topics in the History of Science and Technology\n\n9 units (3-0-6)\n\nThis is an advanced humanities course on a specialized topic in HPS and\nHistory. It is usually taught by new or visiting faculty. The course may be\nre-taken for credit except as noted in the course announcement. Limited to 15\nstudents. See registrar's announcement for details.\n\nInstructors: Staff, visiting lecturers\n\nHPS/H 170\n\n##  History of Light from Antiquity to the 20th Century\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second, third terms\n\nPrerequisites: Ph 1 abc, and Ph 2 abc (may be taken concurrently).\n\nA study of the experimental, mathematical, and theoretical developments\nconcerning light, from the time of Ptolemy in the 2nd century A.D. to the\nproduction of electromagnetic optics in the 20th century. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Buchwald\n\nHPS/H 171\n\n##  History of Mechanics from Galileo through Euler\n\n9 units (3-0-6)\n\nPrerequisites: Ph 1 abc, and Ph 2 abc (may be taken concurrently).\n\nThis course covers developments in mechanics, as well as related aspects of\nmathematics and models of nature, from just before the time of Galileo through\nthe middle of the 18th century, which saw the creation of fluid and rotational\ndynamics in the hands of Euler and others. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nHPS/H 172\n\n##  History of Mathematics: A Global View with Close-ups\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | offered by announcement\n\nThe course will provide students with a brief yet adequate survey of the\nhistory of mathematics, characterizing the main developments and placing these\nin their chronological, cultural, and scientific contexts. A more detailed\nstudy of a few themes, such as Archimedes' approach to infinite processes, the\nchanging meanings of \"analysis\" in mathematics, Descartes' analytic geometry,\nand the axiomatization of geometry c. 1900; students' input in the choice of\nthese themes will be welcomed. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nHPS/H 175\n\n##  Matter, Motion, and Force: Physical Astronomy from Ptolemy to Newton\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThe course will examine how elements of knowledge that evolved against\nsignificantly different cultural and religious backgrounds motivated the great\nscientific revolution of the 17th century. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nHPS/H 180\n\n##  Forbidden Knowledge\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nWhy does the notion of freedom of knowledge and teaching in science and\nengineering matter? What kinds of restrictions have been placed on scientists\nand engineers, their publications and institutions? Who restrained scientific\nand engineering knowledge of what sorts; for what reasons; and how\nsuccessfully? These questions will be addressed by exploring the strategies\ndeveloped by the U.S. research community to protect the international\ncirculation of knowledge after World War II, when scientific freedom and the\nexport of technical data had to be balanced with the needs of national\nsecurity. Case studies will include the atomic bomb, the semiconductor\nindustry in the 1970s and space technologies, notably rockets/missiles, in the\n1990s. The threat to U.S. economics and military security posed by the Soviet\nUnion in the Cold War, and by China today, has transformed the practice of\nresearch in university and in industry alike building new walls around the\nproduction and circulation of knowledge to affirm national sovereignty that\nis, all the while, being undermined by the global circulation of trained\nscientists and engineers. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nH/HPS/VC 185\n\n##  Angels and Monsters: Cosmology, Anthropology, and the Ends of the World\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course explores late medieval European understandings of the origins,\nstructure, and workings of the cosmos in the realms of theology, physics,\nastronomy, astrology, magic, and medicine. Attention is given to the position\nof humans as cultural creatures at the intersection of nature and spirit; as\nwell as to the place of Christian Europeans in relation to non-Christians and\nother categories of outsiders within and beyond Europe. We will examine the\nknowledge system that anticipated racializing theories in the West.\n\nInstructor: Wey-Gomez\n\nH/HPS/VC 186\n\n##  From Plato to Pluto: Maps, Exploration and Culture from Antiquity to the\nPresent\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course covers a broad range of topics in the history of maps and\nexploration from Antiquity to the present. These topics range from the\nearliest visualizations of earth and space in the Classical world to\ncontemporary techniques in interplanetary navigation. By way of maps, students\nwill explore various ways in which different cultures have conceptualized and\nnavigated earth and space. While maps emulate the world as perceived by the\nhuman eye, they, in fact, comprise a set of observations and perceptions of\nthe relationship between bodies in space and time. Thus, students will study\nmaps, and the exploration they enable, as windows to the cultures that have\nproduced them, not only as scientific and technical artifacts to measure and\nnavigate our world. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Wey-Gomez\n\nH/L 191\n\n##  Perspectives on History through German Literature\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nIndustrialization, economic growth, and democracy came to Germany much later\nthan to England and France, and the forms they took in Germany were filtered\nthrough the specific institutional character of Central Europe. German-\nspeaking writers and intellectuals saw these trends from the perspective of\nindigenous intellectual traditions, and the resulting collisions of values and\npriorities largely shaped European and American social, political, and\nliterary debates for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This\ncourse explores these writings (in English translation) against the historical\nbackground of Central European society, focusing on particular works of\nGoethe, Hoffmann, Heine, Nietzsche, Kafka, Rilke, and Mann. Not offered\n2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Dennison\n\nH 192\n\n##  The Crusades\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course will introduce students to the series of religiously motivated\nEuropean invasions of the Middle and Near East that began at the end of the\neleventh century and that led to the creation of Latin Christian\nprincipalities in Palestine. Though the crusading movement came to embroil\nmuch of Europe itself, the course will focus strictly on the military\nexpeditions to what the Crusaders called the Holy Land, and the history of the\nCrusader states up to the point of their destruction at the end of the\nthirteenth century. The course will be guided by the following questions: how\ndid medieval Christianity justify wars of aggression against foreign peoples\nand religions? What motivated western Europeans to leave their homes and march\ninto a hostile environment, where they often faced impoverishment if not death\nand where maintaining a Christian presence was a constant struggle? How did\nthey manage to erect stable political entities in alien territory that lasted\nas long as they did, and how did they have to adapt their own culture to do\nso? Finally, how did the native peoples of the regions the Crusaders invaded\nand conquered-Muslim but also Christian and Jewish - perceive the Crusaders?\nHow did the Crusaders' presence affect life in a region whose populations had\ntheir own ancient histories and patterns of life? Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Brown\n\nEn/H 193\n\n##  Cervantes, Truth or Dare: Don Quixote in an Age of Empire\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nStudies Cervantes's literary masterpiece, Don Quixote, with a view to the\ngreat upheavals that shaped the early modern world: Renaissance Europe's\ndiscovery of America; feudalism's demise and the rise of mass poverty;\nReformation and Counter-Reformation; extermination of heretics and war against\ninfidels; and the decline of the Hapsburg dynasty. The hapless protagonist of\nDon Quixote calls into question the boundaries between sanity and madness,\ntruth and falsehood, history and fiction, objectivity and individual\nexperience. What might be modern, perhaps even revolutionary, in Cervantes's\ndramatization of the moral and material dilemmas of his time? Conducted in\nEnglish.\n\nInstructor: Wey-Gomez\n\nH 201\n\n##  Reading and Research for Graduate Students\n\nUnits to be determined for the individual by the division\n\n"

Using a range of primary and secondary sources, we will examine how\nscientific ideas about race developed in concert with European imperial\nexpansion and slavery; how these ideas were employed in legal cases, medical\npractice, and eugenics policies; and how activists and scholars have\nchallenged racist practices and ideas. Finally, we will turn to the recent\nresurgence of racial thinking in biology and medicine in the light of the\nhistory of race and science. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nHum/H/HPS 15\n\n##  Waste in the World\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second, third terms\n\nThe things that human beings make and throw away rarely stay where we put\nthem. Just as humans have shaped the biological and physical world, the\nbiological and physical world shapes human actions. In this course, we will\nexamine how these interacting forces propel environmental and cultural change.\nWe will explore these concepts through the lens of waste - how different\ngroups at different points in history define waste, where discarded things go\nand what they become as they move through space and time. We will consider how\nconflicting perceptions of utility and waste in different cultural and\nhistorical contexts have factored into shifting ideas about race, class,\ngender, wilderness, technology, consumption, and sovereignty. In rethinking\nwaste, we will explore the multiple meanings of \"nature,\" assess the roots of\nsustainability, and evaluate past events in light of current ideas about\nenvironmental justice. While this course prioritizes reading and discussion,\nwe will also engage with the world around us through visual analysis. Pasadena\nand Los Angeles will be among our most important resources, allowing us to\nground global ideas in a local context.\n\nInstructor: Rand\n\nHum/H/HPS 18\n\n##  Introduction to the History of Science\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second, third terms\n\nMajor topics include the following: What are the origins of modern Western\nscience, when did it emerge as distinct from philosophy and other cultural and\nintellectual productions, and what are its distinguishing features? When and\nhow did observation, experiment, quantification, and precision enter the\npractice of science? What were some of the major turning points in the history\nof science? What is the changing role of science and technology? Using primary\nand secondary sources, students will take up significant topics in the history\nof science, from ancient Greek science to the 20th-century revolution in\nphysics, biology, and technology. Hum/H/HPS 10 may be taken for credit toward\nthe additional 36-unit HSS requirement by HPS majors and minors who have\nalready fulfilled their first-year humanities requirement and counts as a\nhistory course in satisfying the first-year humanities breadth requirement.\n\nInstructor: Feingold\n\nHum/H/HPS 20\n\n##  COVID-19 and Other Pandemics: Science, Medicine, and Public Controversies\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course will analyze the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of other similar\nevents in the history of public health and medicine. How do we understand the\nCOVID pandemic and the differential responses to it around the globe? What is\nthe best framework for proper understanding? Science, history, politics,\nculture? Special attention will be given to the state of medical science today\nand in the past, the understanding of ethology, transmission, and symptoms;\nthe role of scientists, physicians, and \"quacks\"; the persistence and change\nin the forms of fear, superstition, and misinformation across time.\n\nInstructor: Kormos-Buchwald\n\nHPS 90\n\n##  Public Lecture Series\n\n1 unit | first, second, third terms\n\nStudents attend four lectures, featuring speakers from outside Caltech, on\ntopics in the history and philosophy of science. Students may choose from a\nvariety of regularly scheduled HPS lectures, including HPS seminars, Harris\nlectures, and History seminars (history or philosophy of science only). Graded\non attendance. Not available for credit toward the humanities-social science\nrequirement. Graded pass/fail.\n\nInstructor: Visiting lecturers\n\nHPS 98\n\n##  Reading in History and Philosophy of Science\n\n9 units (1-0-8)\n\nPrerequisites: instructor's permission.\n\nAn individual program of directed reading in history and philosophy of\nscience, in areas not covered by regular courses.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nHPS 102 ab\n\n##  Senior Research Seminar\n\n12 units (2-0-10)\n\nOffered in any two consecutive terms, by arrangement with HPS faculty. Under\nthe guidance of an HPS faculty member, students will research and write a\nfocused research paper of 15,000 words (approximately 50 pages). Work in the\nfirst term will comprise intensive reading in the relevant literature and/or\narchival or other primary source research. In the second term, students will\ndraft and revise their paper. Open to seniors in the HPS option and to others\nby special permission of an HPS faculty member. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nHPS/Pl/CS 110\n\n##  Causation and Explanation\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nAn examination of theories of causation and explanation in philosophy and\nneighboring disciplines. Topics discussed may include probabilistic and\ncounterfactual treatments of causation, the role of statistical evidence and\nexperimentation in causal inference, and the deductive-nomological model of\nexplanation. The treatment of these topics by important figures from the\nhistory of philosophy such as Aristotle, Descartes, and Hume may also be\nconsidered.\n\nInstructor: Eberhardt\n\nHPS/Pl 120\n\n##  Introduction to Philosophy of Science\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nAn introduction to fundamental philosophical problems concerning the nature of\nscience. Topics may include the character of scientific explanation, criteria\nfor the conformation and falsification of scientific theories, the\nrelationship between theory and observation, philosophical accounts of the\nconcept of \"law of nature,\" causation, chance, realism about unobservable\nentities, the objectivity of science, and issues having to do with the ways in\nwhich scientific knowledge changes over time.\n\nInstructor: McKenna\n\nHPS/Pl 122\n\n##  Probability, Evidence, and Belief\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nPhilosophical and conceptual issues arising from the study of probability\ntheory and how it relates to rationality and belief. Topics discussed may\ninclude the foundations and interpretations of probability, arguments for and\nagainst the view that we ought to have personal degrees of belief, rational\nchange in beliefs over time, and the relationship between probability and\ntraditional epistemological topics like evidence, justification, and\nknowledge.\n\nInstructor: Hitchcock\n\nHPS/Pl 123\n\n##  Introduction to the Philosophy of Physics\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nPrerequisites: Ph 1 abc or instructor's permission.\n\nThis course will examine the philosophical foundations of the physical\ntheories covered in the first-year physics sequence: classical mechanics,\nelectromagnetism, and special relativity. Topics may include: the goals of\nphysics; what laws of nature are; the unification of physical theories;\nsymmetries; determinism; locality; the reality of fields; the arrow of time.\n\nInstructor: Sebens\n\nHPS/Pl 124\n\n##  Philosophy of Space and Time\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course will focus on questions about the nature of space and time,\nparticularly as they arise in connection with physical theory. Topics may\ninclude the nature and existence of space, time, and motion; the relationship\nbetween geometry and physical space (or space-time); entropy and the direction\nof time; the nature of simultaneity; and the possibility of time travel.\n\nInstructor: Hitchcock\n\nHPS/Pl 125\n\n##  Philosophical Issues in Quantum Physics\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nPrerequisites: Ph 2 b, Ph 12 b, or Ch 21 a.\n\nThis course will focus on philosophical and foundational questions raised by\nquantum physics. Questions may include: Is quantum mechanics a local theory?\nIs the theory deterministic or indeterministic? What is the role of\nmeasurement and observation? Does the wave function always obey the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation? Does the wave function give a complete description of\nthe state of a system? Are there parallel universes? How are we to understand\nquantum probabilities?\n\nInstructor: Sebens\n\nHPS/Pl 128\n\n##  Philosophy of Mathematics\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nAn examination of conceptual issues that arise in mathematics. The sorts of\nissues addressed may include the following: Are mathematical objects such as\nnumbers in some sense real? How do we obtain knowledge of the mathematical\nworld? Are proofs the only legitimate source of mathematical knowledge? What\nis the relationship between mathematics and the world? How is it possible to\napply abstract theory to the world? Views of major historical figures such as\nPlato, Hume, Kant, and Mill, as well as of contemporary writers are examined.\nThe course will also examine philosophical issues that arise in particular\nareas of mathematics such as probability theory and geometry. Not offered\n2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Hitchcock\n\nH/HPS 129\n\n##  History of Satellites: From Sputnik to Starlink\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThe artificial satellites encircling the planet make up a global information\ninfrastructure. Most of us living in industrialized regions use satellites\ndaily without even realizing it. How did satellites become so integral to\nterrestrial technological systems? How did Earth orbit transform from a\nwilderness into a landscape during the second half of the 20th century, and\nhow is that landscape changing in the 21st? We will trace the history of\nsatellites beginning with the first artificial \"moons\" and moving into the\ncurrent moment of private industry ascendance, taking into account the\ndevelopment, use, and decay of these technologies. We will consider how\ndesigners and users shape satellites, and map out the ways that objects in\norbit reflect and reinforce power and geopolitics on the ground below. Not\noffered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Rand\n\nH/HPS 130\n\n##  Critical Infrastructures\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nIn much of mainstream American culture an enthusiasm for innovation can\novershadow the older, established technologies that (often invisibly) sustain\nsociety. In this course, we will examine the interplay of environment,\ntechnology, and labor that shapes infrastructures and the acts of maintenance\nthat sustain these naturalized systems. We will explore the history and\npolitics of local and regional networks including but not limited to energy,\ntransportation, and information. This course includes site visits and\npresentations by campus infrastructure experts that help guide our critical\nencounters with the naturalized technological systems that support daily life\nand work at Caltech, and which both connect us to and separate us from the\nsurrounding region.\n\nInstructor: Rand\n\nH/HPS 131\n\n##  History of Extinction\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nHumans are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction-the first to be caused by\nhuman activity. Extinction has been viewed in changing ways over the past 200\nyears, and this course takes an interdisciplinary approach to learning about\nthe extinction process from a historical as well as a modern perspective. Our\nfocus will be on the extinction of biological entities, but we will also touch\non other systems that have disappeared: languages, technologies, habitats, and\nways of living. Central to our endeavors will be asking what it means to live\nin this time of loss: Should we mourn? And if so, how do we mourn for what\nmany or most of us do not see, but only read about? Finally, we will\nscrutinize what the practical effects of extinction have been, are, and will\nbe. We will also make at least one visit to a natural history museum to view\nsome extinct species behind the scenes.\n\nInstructor: Lewis\n\nH/HPS 132\n\n##  Humanistic Ecology\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nHumans' conceptions of nature have changed dramatically over time. Ecological\nsystems influence human culture, politics, law, and many other spheres, and in\nturn, humans influence those systems. This class introduces students to the\nfield of humanistic ecology-a discipline that looks to a number of cultural,\npolitical, historical and economic elements to better understand the role of\necology in a larger sphere outside of its scientific structure and uses.\nHumanistic ecology is designed to provide context for the study of ecology,\nand in a fundamental way, focuses on the appropriate role of humanity in its\nrelationship to nature: what is ethical, or not, what is useful, or not, and a\nvariety of other matters that should be considered when taking a fully three-\ndimensional view of ecological science. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Lewis\n\nH/HPS 133\n\n##  Forests and Humans\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nForests - which cover 31 percent of the world's land surface - have played\nessential roles in enhancing the planet's biodiversity. Forests have also\nserved humans in numerous and often controversial ways, and have also been\nsubjected to dramatic change through human activity. How well have we served\nforests, as well as being served by them? The class will cover the growth and\nuse of forests from a humanistic and historic perspective, as well as\ndiscussions about the role of fire in forests, with a particular emphasis on\nthe unprecedented forest fires in California in the past several years and the\nglobal ecological implications. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Lewis\n\nH/HPS 134\n\n##  Birds, Evolution, Speciation and Society\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThe cultural, scientific, social and political roles of birds make them an\nexcellent lens through which to view humans' interactions with the natural\nworld. This course will cover our changing understandings of birds, starting\nwith hawking and falconry in earlier centuries, through the discovery of new\nspecies, up through Darwinian understandings of speciation and evolution, and\ncontinuing up to present scientific understandings of birds' capabilities and\ntheir ties to humankind, as well as to other anchors in the natural world. We\nwill take a strong biographical as well as avian approach to understanding key\npersonalities who furthered our understandings of avian science.\n\nInstructor: Lewis\n\nHPS/Pl 135\n\n##  The Moral Brain\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course will critically examine attempts to understand moral judgment and\nbehavior from the perspective of neuroscience and controversies surrounding\nits implications for moral philosophy. Starting from an evolutionary\nperspective, we will investigate the search for moral precursors in non-human\nprimates and the evolutionary innovations in cognitive, emotional, and\nmotivational mechanisms purported to underlie human morality. From there, we\nwill investigate controversies regarding this emerging \"neuroethics\" for\ndebates in moral psychology and normative ethics, including the role of\nreason, desire, and the self in normative theory and whether neuroscience can\nplay any role in adjudicating among competing theories of normative ethics.\nNot offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Quartz\n\nHPS/Pl 136\n\n##  Happiness and the Good Life\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis course will critically examine the emerging science of happiness and\npositive psychology, its philosophical assumptions, methodology, and its role\nin framing social policy and practice. Topics to be addressed include: the\nrelation between happiness as subjective well-being or life satisfaction and\nphilosophical visions of the good life; the relation between happiness and\nvirtue; the causes of happiness and the role of life experience; happiness and\neconomic notions of human welfare, attempts to measure happiness, and the\nprospect for an economics of happiness; happiness as a brain state and whether\nbrain science can illuminate the nature of happiness; mental illness and\npsychiatry in light of positive psychology.\n\nInstructor: Quartz\n\nHPS/Pl 138\n\n##  Human Nature and Society\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis course will investigate how assumptions about human nature shape\npolitical philosophy, social institutions, and social policy. The course will\nbegin with a historical perspective, examining the work of such political\nphilosophers as Plato, Locke, Rousseau, and Marx, along with such\npsychologists as Freud and Skinner. Against this historical perspective, it\nwill then turn to examine contemporary views on human nature from cognitive\nneuroscience and evolutionary psychology and explore their potential\nimplications for political philosophy and social policy. Among topics to be\ndiscussed will be the nature of human sociality and cooperation; economic\nsystems and assumptions regarding production and consumption; and propaganda,\nmarketing, and manipulation. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Quartz\n\nHPS/Pl 139\n\n##  Human Nature, Welfare, & Sustainability\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nPolicy makers since at least the time of Jeremy Bentham have argued that\nwelfare maximization ought to be the goal of social policy. When this includes\nperfectionist notions of realizing one's capacities, economic prosperity,\nprosocial norms, and democratization have all coincided as key drivers of\nhuman development. Although the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\nenvisions worldwide inclusive and sustainable economic growth, there is\nsubstantial debate regarding the extent to which sustainability and economic\ngrowth are compatible. This course will critically examine the links between\nhuman welfare, economic growth, and material culture to better understand why\neconomic growth and welfare have been taken to be intertwined - and the extent\nto which they could be decoupled. Our starting point will be the Brundtland\nreport, its conception of welfare based on human needs, and subsequent\narticulations of needs-based theories of human welfare, including evolutionary\nand biological accounts that include social comparison processes such as\nesteem, status, and recognition. This will provide us with a theoretical\nframework for investigating the role of material culture in satisfying these\nneeds and whether they may be satisfied by less resource-intense routes. Not\noffered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Quartz\n\nH/HPS 153\n\n##  Inequality and Environment\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis seminar introduces students to the history of environmental inequality,\nenvironmental racism, and environmental justice. Human bodies are inescapably\nenmeshed in our environments: human health and environmental health are\ninseparable. But environmental burdens and benefits are distributed unevenly\nalong lines of race, gender, class, and nationality. We will examine local,\nnational, and transnational case studies to understand the historical\ndevelopment of environmental inequalities and movements for environmental\njustice. We will consider different methods for studying environmental\ninjustice and the politics of environmental knowledge.

This course will introduce\nstudents to the historical development of feminist Science & Technology\nStudies and what this field tells us about the history of women in science,\nthe history of scientific theories of sex/gender, and the future of feminist\nresearch. This reading-heavy class will also include discussions of feminist\nepistemology, feminist research methods, and new directions in feminist STS.\nNot offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nH/HPS 155\n\n##  Mortality Crises and Social Change: Epidemic Disease from 1300 to the\nPresent\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nWhat do we know about epidemics in the past? What did contemporaries\nunderstand about these events? How did societies respond to periodic bouts of\nepidemic disease? This course examines mortality crises and epidemics from the\nBlack Death in the 14th century to the current coronavirus pandemic, with\nattention given to the impact of epidemics on societies, the ways in which\nsuch outbreaks have been understood over time and the kinds of responses they\nhave elicited. We will draw on studies for a range of societies in order to\nidentify patterns across space and time, and to highlight both continuity and\nchange in the ways societies have dealt with contagious diseases. Not offered\n2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Dennison\n\nHPS/H 160\n\n##  Einstein on the Run: European Scientists Fleeing Fascism, War, and the\nHolocaust\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nStructured around the life and work of Albert Einstein (1879-1955), the course\nwill focus on the 1930s and 1940s, including the discovery of nuclear fission\nand the making of the atom bomb. Colleagues of Einstein, such as Max Born,\nHans Bethe, Enrico Fermi, Lise Meitner, Erwin Schrodinger, and untold numbers\nof students, scientists, and engineers were forced out of their universities\nand laboratories by the rise of Fascism in Europe and sought shelter in the\nUnited States and elsewhere. Many contributed to the Allied World War II\neffort. Einstein himself became a facilitator for immigrant scientists,\nintellectuals, and artists seeking refuge. We shall use historical documents\nfrom the Einstein Archives to understand the complex collective and individual\nexperiences and their impact on developments in science and technology during\nthis turbulent historical period.\n\nInstructor: Kormos-Buchwald\n\nHPS/H 162\n\n##  Social Studies of Science\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nA comparative, multidisciplinary course that examines the practice of science\nin a variety of locales, using methods from the history, sociology, and\nanthropology of scientific knowledge.

See registrar's announcement for details.\n\nInstructors: Staff, visiting lecturers\n\nHPS/H 166\n\n##  Historical Perspectives on the Relations between Science and Religion\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThe course develops a framework for understanding the changing relations\nbetween science and religion in Western culture since antiquity. Focus will be\non the ways in which the conceptual, personal, and social boundaries between\nthe two domains have been reshaped over the centuries. Questions to be\naddressed include the extent to which a particular religious doctrine was more\nor less amenable to scientific work in a given period, how scientific activity\ncarved an autonomous domain, and the roles played by scientific activity in\nthe overall process of secularization.\n\nInstructor: Feingold\n\nHPS/H 167\n\n##  Experimenting with History/Historic Experiment\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nPrerequisites: Ph 1 abc, and Ph 2 abc (may be taken concurrently).\n\nThis course uses a combination of lectures with hands-on laboratory work to\nbring out the methods, techniques, and knowledge that were involved in\nbuilding and conducting historical experiments. We will connect our laboratory\nwork with the debates and claims made by the original discoverers, asking such\nquestions as how experimental facts have been connected to theories, how\nanomalies arise and are handled, and what sorts of conditions make\nhistorically for good data. Typical experiments might include investigations\nof refraction, laws of electric force, interference of polarized light,\nelectromagnetic induction, or resonating circuits and electric waves. We will\nreconstruct instrumentation and experimental apparatus based on a close\nreading of original sources. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Buchwald\n\nHPS/H 168\n\n##  History of Electromagnetism and Heat Science\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nPrerequisites: Ph 1 abc, and Ph 2 abc (may be taken concurrently).\n\nThis course covers the development of electromagnetism and thermal science\nfrom its beginnings in the early 18th century through the early 20th century.\nTopics covered include electrostatics, magnetostatics, electrodynamics,\nMaxwell's field theory, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and\nstatistical mechanics as well as related experimental discoveries.\n\nInstructor: Buchwald\n\nHPS/H 169\n\n##  Selected Topics in the History of Science and Technology\n\n9 units (3-0-6)\n\nThis is an advanced humanities course on a specialized topic in HPS and\nHistory.

Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nHPS/H 172\n\n##  History of Mathematics: A Global View with Close-ups\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | offered by announcement\n\nThe course will provide students with a brief yet adequate survey of the\nhistory of mathematics, characterizing the main developments and placing these\nin their chronological, cultural, and scientific contexts. A more detailed\nstudy of a few themes, such as Archimedes' approach to infinite processes, the\nchanging meanings of \"analysis\" in mathematics, Descartes' analytic geometry,\nand the axiomatization of geometry c. 1900; students' input in the choice of\nthese themes will be welcomed. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nHPS/H 175\n\n##  Matter, Motion, and Force: Physical Astronomy from Ptolemy to Newton\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThe course will examine how elements of knowledge that evolved against\nsignificantly different cultural and religious backgrounds motivated the great\nscientific revolution of the 17th century. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nHPS/H 180\n\n##  Forbidden Knowledge\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nWhy does the notion of freedom of knowledge and teaching in science and\nengineering matter? What kinds of restrictions have been placed on scientists\nand engineers, their publications and institutions? Who restrained scientific\nand engineering knowledge of what sorts; for what reasons; and how\nsuccessfully? These questions will be addressed by exploring the strategies\ndeveloped by the U.S. research community to protect the international\ncirculation of knowledge after World War II, when scientific freedom and the\nexport of technical data had to be balanced with the needs of national\nsecurity. Case studies will include the atomic bomb, the semiconductor\nindustry in the 1970s and space technologies, notably rockets/missiles, in the\n1990s. The threat to U.S. economics and military security posed by the Soviet\nUnion in the Cold War, and by China today, has transformed the practice of\nresearch in university and in industry alike building new walls around the\nproduction and circulation of knowledge to affirm national sovereignty that\nis, all the while, being undermined by the global circulation of trained\nscientists and engineers. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nPl/HPS 183\n\n##  Bioethics\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first, third terms\n\nA survey of issues in bioethics. Topics may include: abortion and reproductive\nrights; euthanasia; physician-patient relationships; use of human embryos and\nstem cells in research; use of human subjects in research and the concept of\ninformed consent; research on and treatment of non-human animals; organ\ntransplantation, distribution, and sale; genetic modification of organisms\n(including humans); synthetic biology; cure vs. enhancement and other issues\nin biotechnology and neuroethics.\n\nInstructors: Gurcan, Helou\n\nH/HPS/VC 185\n\n##  Angels and Monsters: Cosmology, Anthropology, and the Ends of the World\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course explores late medieval European understandings of the origins,\nstructure, and workings of the cosmos in the realms of theology, physics,\nastronomy, astrology, magic, and medicine. Attention is given to the position\nof humans as cultural creatures at the intersection of nature and spirit; as\nwell as to the place of Christian Europeans in relation to non-Christians and\nother categories of outsiders within and beyond Europe. We will examine the\nknowledge system that anticipated racializing theories in the West.\n\nInstructor: Wey-Gomez\n\nH/HPS/VC 186\n\n##  From Plato to Pluto: Maps, Exploration and Culture from Antiquity to the\nPresent\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course covers a broad range of topics in the history of maps and\nexploration from Antiquity to the present. These topics range from the\nearliest visualizations of earth and space in the Classical world to\ncontemporary techniques in interplanetary navigation. By way of maps, students\nwill explore various ways in which different cultures have conceptualized and\nnavigated earth and space. While maps emulate the world as perceived by the\nhuman eye, they, in fact, comprise a set of observations and perceptions of\nthe relationship between bodies in space and time. Thus, students will study\nmaps, and the exploration they enable, as windows to the cultures that have\nproduced them, not only as scientific and technical artifacts to measure and\nnavigate our world. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Wey-Gomez\n\n"

It will\nemphasize the reading and discussion of primary sources, especially but not\nexclusively literary works, against the backdrop of the broad historical\nnarrative of the periods. The readings will present students with the\nessential characteristics of various ancient and medieval societies and give\nstudents access to those societies' cultural assumptions and perceptions of\nchange.\n\nInstructor: Brown\n\nHum/H 2\n\n##  Freedom Dreams: African American Visions of Liberation Since Emancipation\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nOver the course of their history in the United States, African Americans have\nadvanced various visions of liberation and strategies for attaining it. This\ncourse will examine how African Americans have conceptualized and sought to\nrealize their freedom dreams since the end of chattel slavery. We will focus,\nin particular, on visions of freedom considered radical or utopian, both in\ntheir contemporary moment and in our present. Investigating how African\nAmericans have imagined freer lives beyond their own localities, beyond U.S.\nborders, and even beyond Earth, our topics of discussion in the course may\ninclude emigration movements, black communism, pan-Africanism, black feminism,\ncults, Afrofuturism, hip hop culture, and abolitionism.\n\nInstructor: Wiggins\n\nHum/H 3\n\n##  The United States in the Twentieth Century\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nDesigned to introduce students to the academic study of history, this course\nexamines key issues and events that shaped the political, social, and cultural\nhistory of the United States in the Twentieth Century. Through a wide variety\nof historical sources-including primary documents, fiction, and music-students\nwill explore issues such as popular culture, immigration and labor, the civil\nrights movement, political realignment, and American intervention abroad.

This course will particularly emphasize how the making, writing,\nand remembering of history responds to the advent of different regimes of\nlegitimacy in order to give students a new perspective on the relationship\nbetween action, authorship, and interpretation in history. Not offered\n2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nHum/H 6\n\n##  Civilization, Science, and Archaeology: The Development of Science from\nBabylon through the Renaissance\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second, third terms\n\nConnections in antiquity between astrology and astronomy, early theories of\nlight, Islamic science, new concepts of knowledge during the European Middle\nAges and Renaissance, the early laboratory, the development of linear\nperspective, the origins of the Copernican and Keplerian systems of astronomy,\nand the science of Galileo. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Buchwald\n\nHum/H 7\n\n##  Civilization, Science, and Archaeology: The Nature of Religious Belief in\nAncient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Israel\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second, third terms\n\nThe civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia gave rise to complex forms of\nreligious practices connected to the social order, moral behavior, and the\nafterlife. The course examines the origins of concepts of moral death and of\nsin as a violation of cosmic order in antiquity, the nature of polytheism, and\nthe manner in which monotheism arose out of it. In addition to historical\nanalyses the course includes readings by anthropologists who have studied cult\nstructures as well as contemporary theories by evolutionary psychologists. Not\noffered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Buchwald\n\nHum/H 8\n\n##  Civilization, Science, and Archaeology: Before Greece: The Origins of\nCivilization in Mesopotamia\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second, third terms\n\nThis course will introduce students to the early development of civilization\nin Mesopotamia and Egypt from 4000 B.C.E. through 1000 B.C.E. Origins of\nagriculture and writing, the evolution of the city, and the structures of the\nMesopotamian economy and social order will be discussed. Comparison with\ncontemporary developments in Egypt during the Old and Middle Kingdoms may\ninclude a reading of Gilgamesh from 3000 B.C.E. and of the Egyptian Tale of\nSinuhe. The course concludes with a discussion of life during the late Bronze\nAge. Focus will be on life as it was lived and experienced by many groups in\npre-classical antiquity rather than on kings and dynasties.\n\nInstructor: Buchwald\n\nHum/H 9\n\n##  Europe Transformed\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nWill introduce students to major aspects of the politics and culture of\nmodernity that have profoundly transformed Western society and consciousness\nfrom the French Revolution to the contemporary era. A variety of historical,\nliterary, and artistic works will be used to illuminate major social,\nintellectual, and cultural movements. The focus will be on significant and\nwide-ranging historical change (e.g., the industrial revolution, imperialism,\nsocialism, fascism); on cultural innovation (e.g., modernism, impressionism,\ncubism); and on the work of significant thinkers. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Kormos-Buchwald\n\nHum/H 10\n\n##  Medieval Europe: The Problem of Violence\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first, second terms\n\nThis course will explore how people understood violence in Europe between ca.\n500 and ca. 1400 AD. It will focus on the various norms that governed the use\nof violence in a period when the right of free people to carry and use weapons\nwas considered self-evident. Working through primary sources, students will\nexplore the relationship between violence and vengeance, the law, central\nauthority and public order, religion, emotions, public ritual, and economics.\nAs they go along students will consider whether violence can coexist with or\neven promote stable, ordered societies, or whether it by definition creates\ndisorder. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Brown\n\nHum/H 11\n\n##  Love and Death: Using Demography to Study the History of Europe from 1700\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first, third terms\n\nDemographic events-births, marriages, deaths-have always been highly\nresponsive to changes in the local environment. Decisions about when to marry,\nhow many children to have, or what kind of household to live in have always\nbeen closely correlated to decisions people take in other areas of their lives\nand, as a result, can tell us a great deal about the economic, social, and\ncultural worlds people inhabit. This course examines differences in\ndemographic trends in Europe across space and time, from 1700 to the present,\nas well as existing explanations for these differences, including political\neconomic factors, social and cultural norms, biology and disease environments.\nSome topics include: the demographic effects of war, industrialization, and\nurbanization; changes related to the emergence of reliable contraceptive\ntechnologies; changes related to the expansion of economic opportunities for\nwomen; the effects of government policies on demographic decisions. Not\noffered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Dennison\n\nHum/H 12\n\n##  Social Theory\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis course introduces students to both canonical and non-canonical theories\nof society. From the formative debates over the role of the state in human\naffairs in early modern Europe to radical interpretations of social good in\nthe twentieth century, students will be exposed to competing theories of\nsociety and their implications in the political, the economic, the emotional,\nand the scientific realms. By the end of the quarter, students will be able to\nlink contemporary notions of individuality, agency, rationality, morality, and\nethics to divergent discourses in the history of social theory. Not offered\n2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nHum/H 13\n\n##  Brave New Worlds: Race, Human Rights and the Age of Discovery\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course traces the origins of modern racism and, perhaps surprisingly, of\nhuman rights advocacy itself, to a seminal moment in global history sometimes\ncalled the Age of Discovery. At this time, two small European kingdoms, Spain\nand Portugal, first conducted trade and conquest in Atlantic Africa, the\nAmericas, and the Indian and Pacific Oceans, forging the world's first truly\nglobal empires. We study the legacy of racism and humanitarianism in eye-\nwitness accounts, maps, images and other materials attesting to Spain's\nseminal encounters with the Americas.\n\nInstructor: Wey-Gomez\n\nHum/H/HPS 14\n\n##  Race, Science, and Medicine in U.S. History\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course will explore how natural philosophers and scientists have defined,\nused, and sometimes challenged ideas about race from the eighteenth century to\ntoday. Using a range of primary and secondary sources, we will examine how\nscientific ideas about race developed in concert with European imperial\nexpansion and slavery; how these ideas were employed in legal cases, medical\npractice, and eugenics policies; and how activists and scholars have\nchallenged racist practices and ideas. Finally, we will turn to the recent\nresurgence of racial thinking in biology and medicine in the light of the\nhistory of race and science. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nHum/H/HPS 15\n\n##  Waste in the World\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second, third terms\n\nThe things that human beings make and throw away rarely stay where we put\nthem. Just as humans have shaped the biological and physical world, the\nbiological and physical world shapes human actions. In this course, we will\nexamine how these interacting forces propel environmental and cultural change.\nWe will explore these concepts through the lens of waste - how different\ngroups at different points in history define waste, where discarded things go\nand what they become as they move through space and time. We will consider how\nconflicting perceptions of utility and waste in different cultural and\nhistorical contexts have factored into shifting ideas about race, class,\ngender, wilderness, technology, consumption, and sovereignty. In rethinking\nwaste, we will explore the multiple meanings of \"nature,\" assess the roots of\nsustainability, and evaluate past events in light of current ideas about\nenvironmental justice. While this course prioritizes reading and discussion,\nwe will also engage with the world around us through visual analysis. Pasadena\nand Los Angeles will be among our most important resources, allowing us to\nground global ideas in a local context.\n\nInstructor: Rand\n\nHum/H/HPS 18\n\n##  Introduction to the History of Science\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second, third terms\n\nMajor topics include the following: What are the origins of modern Western\nscience, when did it emerge as distinct from philosophy and other cultural and\nintellectual productions, and what are its distinguishing features? When and\nhow did observation, experiment, quantification, and precision enter the\npractice of science? What were some of the major turning points in the history\nof science? What is the changing role of science and technology? Using primary\nand secondary sources, students will take up significant topics in the history\nof science, from ancient Greek science to the 20th-century revolution in\nphysics, biology, and technology. Hum/H/HPS 10 may be taken for credit toward\nthe additional 36-unit HSS requirement by HPS majors and minors who have\nalready fulfilled their first-year humanities requirement and counts as a\nhistory course in satisfying the first-year humanities breadth requirement.\n\nInstructor: Feingold\n\nHum/H 19\n\n##  Righting the Wrongs of History\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nIn recent years, growing numbers of people committed to equity and social\njustice have discussed various ways of addressing historical injustices whose\nharms are still experienced in the present. Some have proposed monetary\nrestitution and other restorative strategies that account for resources,\nopportunities, and lives lost. Others have advocated more symbolic reparative\napproaches that seek to heal the psychic wounds of injustice. This course will\nexamine efforts to right the wrongs of history, with particular attention\ngiven to the decades-long movement for reparations for African Americans and\nrecent efforts to address difficult histories at Caltech. Investigating\ninitiatives that have been realized and others that have been only imagined,\nin this course we will seek to understand both the possibilities and\nimpossibilities of repairing historical harms. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Wiggins\n\nHum/H/HPS 20\n\n##  COVID-19 and Other Pandemics: Science, Medicine, and Public Controversies\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course will analyze the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of other similar\nevents in the history of public health and medicine. How do we understand the\nCOVID pandemic and the differential responses to it around the globe? What is\nthe best framework for proper understanding? Science, history, politics,\nculture? Special attention will be given to the state of medical science today\nand in the past, the understanding of ethology, transmission, and symptoms;\nthe role of scientists, physicians, and \"quacks\"; the persistence and change\nin the forms of fear, superstition, and misinformation across time.\n\nInstructor: Kormos-Buchwald\n\nHum/En 21\n\n##  Monsters and Marvels\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second, third terms\n\nMarvels flourish at the boundaries of literary invention, religious belief,\nand scientific inquiry, challenging assumptions about natural processes and\nexpected outcomes. From Grendel, the monstrous foe of Beowulf, to Satan,\nMilton's charismatic antihero, this seminar examines the uses of the marvelous\nin a variety of texts and genres, including Shakespearian drama, medieval\nromance, and early travel-writing. Readings may include Beowulf, Marie de\nFrance, Chaucer, John Mandeville, Shakespeare, Milton. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Jahner\n\nHum/En 22\n\n##  Inequality\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second, third terms\n\nThis class studies a sample group of social hierarchies and explores whether\nthey are natural or artificial, real or perceived, just or unjust. Topics from\npast years have included covid-19 vaccine inequality; IT worker inequality;\nhappiness inequality; animal inequality; and inequality between humans and\ngenerative AI chatbots. We will treat the idea of inequality not as an\nabstract concept but as a heuristic question that can help us compare and\nanalyze concrete readings.\n\nInstructor: Haugen\n\nHum/En 23\n\n##  Literature and Medicine\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThe relationship between patients and doctors, the ill and the well, involves\na constant exchange of stories. In this course we will look more closely at\nthe relationship between medicine and narrative through a selection of\nfiction, essays and poems that investigate the interplay between doubt and\ndiagnosis, the idea of the case study, the problem of medical responsibility,\nand the language of pain and illness. Authors covered may include Sontag,\nMantel, Conan Doyle, Freud, Woolf, Dickinson, Ishiguro and Shelley.\n\nInstructor: Gilmore\n\nHum/En 24\n\n##  The Scientific Imagination in English Literature\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis course considers three periods of major scientific development-the\nRenaissance, the nineteenth century, and the modern period- to explore the\ninfluence new ideas, discoveries, and theories had on the imagination of\nEnglish writers. We will look at the early modern interplay between magic and\nscience, Romantic and Victorian debates about evolution, and the twentieth-\ncentury advent of modern physics as we confront consistent tropes like the mad\nscientist, the scientist-hero, and the problem of uncertainty. Authors covered\nmay include Shakespeare, Marlowe, Bacon, Shelley, Darwin, Conan Doyle,\nStevenson, Auden, McEwan, and Stoppard. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Gilmore\n\nHum/En 25\n\n##  The Human Animal\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nEuropean literature has long been a testing ground for radical new ideas which\nhave come to shape our basic understanding of what it means to be a thinking,\nspeaking and perhaps even autonomous human being. The question of what - if\nanything - makes us different from animals was debated from numerous points of\nview: including talking dogs, philosophizing women, bestial men, humanlike\nbeasts, and other creatures that defied the conventions of the time. This\ncourse explores some of the key literary texts that shaped this debate and\npays careful attention to their cultural environments. Selected readings from\nCervantes, La Fontaine, Swift, Rousseau, Buffon, Aikin, and Wollstonecraft,\namong others. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nHum/En 26\n\n##  What Is Imagination?\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nAlbert Einstein once said that imagination is everything, and even more\nimportant than knowledge. This course invites you to think about - and use -\nyour imagination as we explore how the act of imagining has been viewed over\ntime in the service of memory and creativity, in both the arts and the\nsciences. Readings will focus on the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and\nwill include Hume, Moritz, Kant, Novalis, Hoffmann, Coleridge, and Wordsworth.\nNot offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nHum/En 27\n\n##  Introduction to the Modern Novel\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course is an introduction to the study of the contemporary novel in\nEnglish. We will explore the value of reading novels both for their own sake\nand for what they might tell us about the history, culture, and politics of\nthe contemporary English language. We will read around three novels from the\ntwenty-first century, along with relevant essays, keywords, and short stories.\nAuthors read may include Zadie Smith, Bernadine Evaristo, Angie Cruz, Tommy\nOrange, Julie Buntin, Akwaeke Emezi, and Ocean Vuong. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Murphy\n\nHum/En 28\n\n##  Telling Time in American Modernism\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis course will explore modernist literature's relationship to time. We will\nidentify the methods that modernist narratives use to characterize the\nexperience of lived time, or temporality, such as stream of consciousness,\nnon-linear storytelling, and narrative omissions. We will ask: what challenges\ndoes temporal experience pose to clock time and, more broadly, historical\ntime? The course will emphasize the influence of new technologies on modernist\nrepresentations of time and space, including rural and urban space, and\nmodernism's engagement with changing attitudes regarding race, gender and\nsexuality. Students will learn about key movements within American modernism,\nincluding the Harlem Renaissance, and may opt to analyze modernist\nliterature's relationships to other genres, including music and visual\nculture.\n\nInstructor: Sherazi\n\nHum/En 29\n\n##  Dream Narratives\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nDream narratives reveal as much about cultural beliefs and superstitions as\nthey do about techniques of narration and interpretation.

Selected readings from Boccaccio, Descartes,\nCalder\u00f3n, Shakespeare, and Diderot, among others. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nHum/En 30\n\n##  Reading Animals\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nIn this course we will look closely at representations of nonhuman animals in\nliterature from the Middle Ages to our present moment as opportunities to\nrevisit definitions of, and the boundaries created and blurred between, the\n\"human\" and the \"animal.\" Readings may include Marie de France, Marianne\nMoore, Franz Kafka, Donna Haraway, Donika Kelly, and K-Ming Chang. Not offered\n2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Hill\n\nHum/En 31\n\n##  Introduction to Black Literature and Culture in the United States\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis introductory humanities course is for anyone who wishes to celebrate,\nstudy, and pass on Black expressive culture to the next generation.\nAltogether, the course will be an in-depth introduction to the study of Black\nintersectional identities and lived experiences across the United States. Our\ntexts will be comprised of a variety of artistic, cultural, and literary works\nin the US created since before its founding up until today. In addition to\nreading several literary texts, students will have the opportunity to learn\nabout several works of cultural expression that have become beloved\ntouchstones in Black history. Students will also read and apply several\ncritical contexts and methodologies for the study of Black literature and\nculture and will regularly document their own goals for furthering this body\nof work for future scholars. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Murphy\n\nHum/En 33\n\n##  Modern Metamorphoses\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nNarratives of metamorphosis have traditionally used their dramatic subject\nmatter-a radical change of form-as a vehicle for social criticism. This course\nexplores the ways in which twentieth-century writers experiment with the\nconcept of metamorphosis to take on the most pressing political and social\nissues of their day, including slavery, women's rights, and critiques of\ncapitalist excess. Readings to include Kafka, Garnett, Orwell, Tawada, and\nErpenbeck. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nHum/En 34\n\n##  Literature and Deception\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nIn this course, we will be considering lying and other types of deception from\nthe point of view of literature and philosophy, with two main goals in mind:\n1) to compare cultural practices of deception at various times in European\nhistory and 2) to think in general terms about the ability of a literary text\nto convey truth and falsehood. Can a fictional text be \"true\" in any\nmeaningful sense, such as a political one? Or, as many people have thought\nover time, is it more accurate to think about literature as a beautiful lie?\nReadings will include the legend of Till Eulenspiegel as well as texts by\nMachiavelli, Shakespeare, Diderot, and those relating to the Ossian\ncontroversy. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nHum/En 35\n\n##  Beginning with Poems\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first, second terms\n\nWhy begin the study of literature with poems? Written words are the building\nblocks of literature, and poetry, in Coleridge's famous equation, is \"the best\nwords in the best order.\" To be understood and appreciated, poetry requires a\nclose attention to words and their ordering as they are read and reread. All\ngood literature requires such attention, but practically speaking, poetry\nprovides the best way to acquire the art of rereading because of its shorter\nforms. More importantly, poetry can be the most emotionally intense and\nsatisfying of literary forms. We will read a small number of poems written in\nEnglish from the sixteenth to the twenty-first centuries from several genres -\nsonnet, ode, elegy, verse epistle, satire, villanelle - and on several\nsubjects - love, death, and politics. Poets will include William Shakespeare,\nEmily Dickinson, and Louise Gluck. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Pigman\n\nHum/En 36\n\n##  American Literature and Culture\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nStudies of American aesthetics, genres, and ideas from the birth of the nation\nto the present. Students will be introduced to the techniques of formal\nanalysis. We will consider what constitutes evidence in relation to texts and\nhow to develop a persuasive interpretation. Topics may include Nature's\nNation, slavery and its aftermath, individualism and the marketplace, the \"New\nWoman,\" and the relation between word and image.\n\nInstructor: Weinstein\n\nHum/En 37\n\n##  Welcome to Dystopia\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first\n\nThis course surveys a number of literary destinations you would never want to\nvisit in real life: places with near-unsurmountable political and\nenvironmental threats where individuality is crushed and where happy endings\nare hard to come by. Given that life in a dystopia is so awful, what makes\nthis genre of fiction so popular? And what can fictional dystopian societies\nteach us about our own? We will look for answers to these questions in the\nwork of some of the greatest writers of the past century, including Franz\nKafka, Shirley Jackson, Philip K. Dick, Cormac McCarthy, and Ursula K. Le\nGuin, among others.\n\nInstructor: Holland\n\nHum/Pl 40\n\n##  Right and Wrong\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first, second terms\n\nThis course addresses questions such as: Where do our moral ideas come from?\nWhat justifies them? How should they guide our conduct, as individuals and as\na society? What kind of person should one aspire to be? Topics the course may\ndeal with include meta-ethical issues (e.g., What makes an action right or\nwrong? When is one morally responsible for one's actions? How should society\nbe organized?) and normative questions (e.g., Is eating meat morally\nacceptable? What should we tolerate and why? What are society's obligations\ntoward the poor?). In addition, the psychological and neural substrates of\nmoral judgment and decision making may be explored. The course draws on a\nvariety of sources, including selections from the great works of moral and\npolitical philosophy (e.g., Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics, Hobbes's\nLeviathan, Kant's Groundings for a Metaphysics of Morals, and Rawls's A Theory\nof Justice), contemporary discussions of particular moral issues, and the\nscience of moral thought.\n\nInstructor: Quartz\n\nHum/Pl 41\n\n##  Knowledge and Reality\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first, second terms\n\nThe theme of this course is the scope and limitations of rational belief and\nknowledge. Students will examine the nature of reality, the nature of the\nself, the nature of knowledge, and how we learn about the natural world.\nStudents will be introduced to these issues through selections from some of\nthe world's greatest philosophical works, including Descartes's Meditations,\nPascal's Pens\u00e9es, Hume's Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Berkeley's\nPrinciples of Human Knowledge, and Kant's Prolegomena to any Future\nMetaphysics. A variety of more contemporary readings will also be assigned.\n\nInstructors: Eberhardt, Hitchcock\n\nHum/Pl 44\n\n##  Philosophy Through Science Fiction\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course will provide a broad introduction to philosophy using examples\nfrom science fiction to make abstract philosophical problems vivid. Topics may\ninclude: time travel and the reality of the past and future; teleportation and\nwhat makes someone the same person over time; fictional tales of extended\ndeception and Cartesian skepticism; futuristic utopias and the question of\nwhat make a life good; the moral status of aliens and animals; intelligent\nrobots and the relation between mind and body; parallel universes and the\nphilosophical foundations of quantum physics.\n\nHum/Pl 45\n\n##  Ethics & AI\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nHow do we reconcile the possibilities of modern machine learning with ethical\nand moral demands of fairness, accountability and transparency? This course\nwill take a case study-based approach to the challenges at the interface of\nalgorithms and human values. By exploring existing debates on algorithmic\nbias, explainable AI and data ownership, students will be exposed to the\nrelevance of ethical systems of thought to modern social questions.\n\nInstructor: Eberhardt\n\nHum/VC 48\n\n##  Ways of Seeing\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\n\"The knowledge of photography is just as important as that of the alphabet,\"\nwrote artist L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy in 1928. \"The illiterate of the future,\" he\nwarned, \"will be the person ignorant of the use of the camera as well as the\npen.\" Almost a century later, this pronouncement rings as true as ever in a\nworld so profoundly shaped not just by photography but also films,\nadvertisements, and video games, cartoons and comics, molecular graphics and\nvisual models. In this course we will explore how visual culture shapes our\nlives and daily experiences, and we will learn to find wonder in its rich\ndetails. In doing so, we will develop the visual literacy that Moholy-Nagy\nenvisioned: essential skills in reading, analyzing, discussing, and writing\nabout visual materials and their circulation through the physical and virtual\nnetworks that structure our world.\n\nInstructor: Jacobson\n\nHum/VC 49\n\n##  Seeing Race\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nFrom colorblind casting to racial profiling, visual culture is at the heart of\ncontemporary conversations about race and racism. We are living in a moment\nwhere representations of racial differences are both highly visible and highly\ncontested in art, popular culture, and mass media across the US and in many\nother parts of the world. Rather than treat these representations as\nreflections of reality, this course takes a critical look at the relationship\nbetween visual culture and the production of (racialized) knowledge and\nsituates this relationship in a broader global and historical context. We will\nconsider how images shape our 'common sense' ideas about race and its\nintersections with ability, gender, and sexuality, and explore how race\ninforms what - and how - we see. In addition to reading landmark literature by\nscholars like Frantz Fanon, bell hooks, Richard Dyer, Edward Said, and Jodi\nByrd, students will engage with artists, filmmakers, and activists who work to\ndismantle what Nicholas Mirzoeff (2023) calls \"white sight\" or the distinctive\nways of seeing that characterize white supremacy.\n\nInstructor: Stielau\n\nHum/VC 50\n\n##  Introduction to Film\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first, third terms\n\nThis course examines the historical development of film as a popular art and\nentertainment medium from the 1880s to the present, with a focus on the\nAmerican and European contexts. Students will learn how to watch a film - how\nto pay attention to significant visual details and to the ways films construct\nmeaning from the language of images - and will develop the skills to write\nfluently about what they see. The course covers some of the most influential\ngenres and movements from the earliest actuality films, through the French New\nWave, to the Disney/Marvel Universe. Films covered may include short comedies\nfrom Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, _M_ , _It Happened One Night_ , _The\nSeven Samurai_ , _The Battle of Algiers_ , and _Black Panther_ .\n\nInstructor: Jurca\n\nHum/VC 51\n\n##  Icons and Iconoclasm\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nHow does something - an image, a person, a thing, an idea - become iconic?\nDrawing from the worlds of art and film, advertising and PR, science and\ntechnology, politics and propaganda, this course explores what makes certain\npeople, places, and things \"icons.\" To do so, we will first deploy a range of\nmethods for closely analyzing images as signs and symbols, including the\npractice art historians term \"iconology.\" We will then examine histories of\nhow objects have circulated through culture - from newspapers and magazines to\npostcards, jpegs, and memes - and thereby become ubiquitous features of\neveryday experience. Finally, we will consider iconoclasm, the destruction of\nicons, and the beliefs and logics behind powerful interdictions against visual\nrepresentation. Students will leave the course with a stronger understanding\nof image power as well as foundational tools of visual and media literacy.

We will practice reading,\nnotating, and analyzing music through the study of rhythm and meter, scales,\nintervals, chords, and basic harmonic progressions; musical examples will be\ndrawn from a variety historical periods and styles, including classical, pop,\njazz, film, and musical theater. The final project will be a short musical\ncomposition. This can be a stand-alone course for students who want to\nunderstand how music is put together, or it can serve as preparation for those\nwho might benefit from a review of the fundamentals before taking further\ncourses in music theory.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nMu 53\n\n##  Listening to Music\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nMost of the music we encounter can be thought of as the organization of a very\nlimited set of tones into distinct patterns of repetition, and it has been\nthis way for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. And yet, music has come to\nmean infinitely more than its sonic surface: we study great works of music\nlike we do great works of literature and art; we use our musical preferences\nto convey our social and political identities; we expect - and technology has\nenabled - our public and private spaces to be saturated in music; and certain\nmusical works possess such power that they are sometimes altered, if not\nbanned outright. But how has music acquired all of these meanings? How does it\ncommunicate? What is it that we are listening to when we are listening to\nmusic? In addition to serving as an introduction to the academic study of\nmusic, this course aims to deepen our musical appreciation and understanding\nby critically examining listening habits of the past and present. Knowledge of\nWestern music notation and harmony is helpful but not required; the basics\nwill be reviewed as needed.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nMu 55\n\n##  The Great Orchestras: Their History, Conductors and Repertoire\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis survey course will trace the symphony orchestra from its origins in the\nmid eighteenth century to the present day.

Nearly two millennia of musical\ndevelopments, needless to say, cannot be adequately covered in ten weeks; the\ncourse thus aims to build literacy in music from these periods by\ncontextualizing musical works and their creators against broader themes,\nincluding music and the church, music and politics, music and gender, the\nevolution of musical notation, and the rise of secular music. At the same\ntime, we will interrogate the central historical narratives of Western music\nthat we have inherited and grapple with how historiography - the writing of\nhistory - shapes the way we understand the musical past and present.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nMu 138\n\n##  Themes in Western Music History and Historiography: 1600-1800\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis course surveys the music and musical institutions of Europe during the\nBaroque and Enlightenment eras.

The course will\nbegin with a historical perspective, examining the work of such political\nphilosophers as Plato, Locke, Rousseau, and Marx, along with such\npsychologists as Freud and Skinner. Against this historical perspective, it\nwill then turn to examine contemporary views on human nature from cognitive\nneuroscience and evolutionary psychology and explore their potential\nimplications for political philosophy and social policy. Among topics to be\ndiscussed will be the nature of human sociality and cooperation; economic\nsystems and assumptions regarding production and consumption; and propaganda,\nmarketing, and manipulation. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Quartz\n\nHPS/Pl 139\n\n##  Human Nature, Welfare, & Sustainability\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nPolicy makers since at least the time of Jeremy Bentham have argued that\nwelfare maximization ought to be the goal of social policy. When this includes\nperfectionist notions of realizing one's capacities, economic prosperity,\nprosocial norms, and democratization have all coincided as key drivers of\nhuman development. Although the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\nenvisions worldwide inclusive and sustainable economic growth, there is\nsubstantial debate regarding the extent to which sustainability and economic\ngrowth are compatible. This course will critically examine the links between\nhuman welfare, economic growth, and material culture to better understand why\neconomic growth and welfare have been taken to be intertwined - and the extent\nto which they could be decoupled. Our starting point will be the Brundtland\nreport, its conception of welfare based on human needs, and subsequent\narticulations of needs-based theories of human welfare, including evolutionary\nand biological accounts that include social comparison processes such as\nesteem, status, and recognition. This will provide us with a theoretical\nframework for investigating the role of material culture in satisfying these\nneeds and whether they may be satisfied by less resource-intense routes.

How did the likes of Singer, John\nDeere and Seth Thomas - latecomers to the markets they served-come to dominate\nthose markets both domestically and internationally? Why did the technology of\ninterchangeable parts and mass production become known as 'the American\nsystem' when much of that technology was imported from Europe? What role did\ngovernment play in facilitating or thwarting innovation and economic growth?\nThis course will explore such questions as reflected in the ordinary things\npeople collect under the label 'antiques'. What do we learn from the fact that\nwe can document a half dozen American manufacturers of apple peelers but not a\nsingle comparable European company? Why is the hand sewn quilt a nearly unique\nAmerican folk art form and what does the evolution of quilting patterns tell\nus about technology and economic prosperity? What do baking powder cans as a\ncategory of collectible tell us about the politics of federal versus state\nregulation? Students will be expected to each choose a topic that asks such\nquestions and to explore possible answers, all with an eye to understanding\nthe interplay of economics, politics, and demography.

Not offered 2024-25.\n\nPS 122\n\n##  Political Representation\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nPrerequisites: PS 12.\n\nWhy does the U.S. Constitution feature separation of powers and protect\nstates' rights? Should the Senate have a filibuster? When can Congress agree\non the best policy for the country (and what does \"best\" even mean)? This\ncourse uses a rigorous set of tools including game theory and social choice to\nhelp students understand the effectiveness of American democracy to represent\ndiverse interests. Using the tools, we study U.S. electoral systems, Congress,\nfederalism, and the courts, with a focus on understanding how the country has\ntried to overcome the challenges of group decision making and the inevitable\nconflicts that arise between the branches of government and divided political\ninterests. Students will leave the course with a deeper understanding of how\nrules and strategy shape U.S. democracy.

It will also\ninvestigate a number of current issues in regulatory politics, including the\ngreat discrepancies that exist in the cost-effectiveness of different\nregulations, and the advent of more market-based approaches to regulations\ninstead of traditional \"command-and-control.\" Not offered on a pass/fail\nbasis.\n\nInstructor: Kiewiet\n\nEc/PS 124\n\n##  Identification Problems in the Social Sciences\n\n9 units (3- 0-6) | second term\n\nPrerequisites: Ec 122.\n\nStatistical inference in the social sciences is a difficult enterprise whereby\nwe combine data and assumptions to draw conclusions about the world we live\nin. We then make decisions, for better or for worse, based on these\nconclusions. A simultaneously intoxicating and sobering thought! Strong\nassumptions about the data generating process can lead to strong but often\nless than credible (perhaps incredible?) conclusions about our world. Weaker\nassumptions can lead to weaker but more credible conclusions. This course\nexplores the range of inferences that are possible when we entertain a range\nof assumptions about how data is generated. We explore these ideas in the\ncontext of a number of applications of interest to social scientists.\n\nInstructor: Sherman\n\nPS 125\n\n##  Analyzing Political Conflict and Violence\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course examines the causes of and solutions for conflict and violence:\nWhy do wars occur and how do we stop them? We cover topics such as terrorism,\nethnic violence, civil wars, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, repression,\nrevolutions, and inter-state wars. We study these phenomena using the rational\nchoice framework and modern tools in data analysis. The goals of the class are\nto explain conflicts and their terminations as outcomes of strategic decision-\nmaking and to understand the empirical strengths and weakness of current\nexplanations.\n\nInstructor: Gibilisco\n\nIDS/Ec/PS 126\n\n##  Applied Data Analysis\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nPrerequisites: Ma 3/103 or ACM/EE/IDS 116, Ec 122 or IDS/ACM/CS 157 or Ma 112\na.\n\nFundamentally, this course is about making arguments with numbers and data.\nData analysis for its own sake is often quite boring, but becomes crucial when\nit supports claims about the world. A convincing data analysis starts with the\ncollection and cleaning of data, a thoughtful and reproducible statistical\nanalysis of it, and the graphical presentation of the results. This course\nwill provide students with the necessary practical skills, chiefly revolving\naround statistical computing, to conduct their own data analysis.

In each topic area\nwe will begin by providing the standard neoclassical account for behavior,\nbuilding from assumptions (axioms) to corresponding utility models. We will\nthen ask whether critical axioms of neoclassical models are plausible by\ncalling upon psychological insights and empirical data. Rejection of\nneoclassical axioms will lead to new models, behavioral economics models, in\neach setting. These models, mechanisms and their testable predictions will be\ndiscussed.\n\nInstructor: Sprenger\n\nEc/Psy 109\n\n##  Frontiers in Behavioral Economics\n\n9 units (3-0-6)\n\nPrerequisites: Ec 11.\n\nThis course will study topics in behavioral economics demonstrating departures\nfrom the classic economics assumptions of rationality and pure self-interest.\nWe will study evidence of these departures, models that have been designed to\ncapture these preferences, and applications of these models to important\neconomic questions.

Emotions aid us in\ndecision-making (gut feelings), help us remember, torment us, yet have\nultimately helped us to survive. Over the past few decades, we have begun to\ncharacterize the neural systems that extend from primitive affective response\nsuch as fight or flight to the complex emotions experienced by humans\nincluding guilt, envy, empathy and social pain. This course will begin with an\nin-depth examination of the neurobiological systems that underlie negative and\npositive emotions and move onto weekly discussions, based on assigned journal\narticles that highlight both rudimentary and complex emotions. The final weeks\nwill be devoted to exploring how the neurobiological systems are disrupted in\naffective disorders including anxiety, aggression and psychopathy. In addition\nto these discussions and readings, each student will be required to write a\nreview paper or produce a short movie on a topic related to one of the\nemotions discussed in these seminars and its underlying neural mechanisms.

        "content": "Hum/VC 48\n\n##  Ways of Seeing\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\n\"The knowledge of photography is just as important as that of the alphabet,\"\nwrote artist L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy in 1928. \"The illiterate of the future,\" he\nwarned, \"will be the person ignorant of the use of the camera as well as the\npen.\" Almost a century later, this pronouncement rings as true as ever in a\nworld so profoundly shaped not just by photography but also films,\nadvertisements, and video games, cartoons and comics, molecular graphics and\nvisual models. In this course we will explore how visual culture shapes our\nlives and daily experiences, and we will learn to find wonder in its rich\ndetails. In doing so, we will develop the visual literacy that Moholy-Nagy\nenvisioned: essential skills in reading, analyzing, discussing, and writing\nabout visual materials and their circulation through the physical and virtual\nnetworks that structure our world.\n\nInstructor: Jacobson\n\nHum/VC 49\n\n##  Seeing Race\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nFrom colorblind casting to racial profiling, visual culture is at the heart of\ncontemporary conversations about race and racism. We are living in a moment\nwhere representations of racial differences are both highly visible and highly\ncontested in art, popular culture, and mass media across the US and in many\nother parts of the world. Rather than treat these representations as\nreflections of reality, this course takes a critical look at the relationship\nbetween visual culture and the production of (racialized) knowledge and\nsituates this relationship in a broader global and historical context. We will\nconsider how images shape our 'common sense' ideas about race and its\nintersections with ability, gender, and sexuality, and explore how race\ninforms what - and how - we see. In addition to reading landmark literature by\nscholars like Frantz Fanon, bell hooks, Richard Dyer, Edward Said, and Jodi\nByrd, students will engage with artists, filmmakers, and activists who work to\ndismantle what Nicholas Mirzoeff (2023) calls \"white sight\" or the distinctive\nways of seeing that characterize white supremacy.\n\nInstructor: Stielau\n\nHum/VC 50\n\n##  Introduction to Film\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first, third terms\n\nThis course examines the historical development of film as a popular art and\nentertainment medium from the 1880s to the present, with a focus on the\nAmerican and European contexts. Students will learn how to watch a film - how\nto pay attention to significant visual details and to the ways films construct\nmeaning from the language of images - and will develop the skills to write\nfluently about what they see. The course covers some of the most influential\ngenres and movements from the earliest actuality films, through the French New\nWave, to the Disney/Marvel Universe. Films covered may include short comedies\nfrom Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, _M_ , _It Happened One Night_ , _The\nSeven Samurai_ , _The Battle of Algiers_ , and _Black Panther_ .\n\nInstructor: Jurca\n\nHum/VC 51\n\n##  Icons and Iconoclasm\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nHow does something - an image, a person, a thing, an idea - become iconic?\nDrawing from the worlds of art and film, advertising and PR, science and\ntechnology, politics and propaganda, this course explores what makes certain\npeople, places, and things \"icons.\" To do so, we will first deploy a range of\nmethods for closely analyzing images as signs and symbols, including the\npractice art historians term \"iconology.\" We will then examine histories of\nhow objects have circulated through culture - from newspapers and magazines to\npostcards, jpegs, and memes - and thereby become ubiquitous features of\neveryday experience. Finally, we will consider iconoclasm, the destruction of\nicons, and the beliefs and logics behind powerful interdictions against visual\nrepresentation. Students will leave the course with a stronger understanding\nof image power as well as foundational tools of visual and media literacy. Not\noffered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Jacobson\n\nVC 60\n\n##  Art/Media\n\nUnits to be determined by the instructor | offered by announcement\n\nA practice-based course taught by a visiting artist in residence. See\nregistrar's announcement for details.\n\nVC 61\n\n##  Environmental Justice\n\n6 units (2-0-4) | first term\n\nThis seminar course will explore and discuss the unique intersection of\nenvironmental racism, environmental justice, and academia. Course material\nwill primarily feature readings and videos on a case study-like basis and\nfocus on bringing conversations typically had in humanities, social sciences\nand activism to the bio and geosciences. Topics will center around two primary\napproaches: an \"outward-facing\" component that looks at environmental racism\nthrough the lens of various activisms, and an \"inward-facing\" component\naddressing the biases/malpractices broadly employed in the biological and\ngeosciences, as well as the apparent moral dilemmas of decisions involving\nmultiple stakeholders. Out of class work will largely be based on assigned\nreadings, some multimedia presentations, and occasional writings and thought\nexercises. This course is taught concurrently with Ge/ESE/Bi 248 and can only\nbe taken once, as VC 61 or Ge/ESE/Bi 248.\n\nInstructor: Mushkin\n\nVC 70\n\n##  Traditions of Japanese Art\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nAn introduction to the great traditions of Japanese art from prehistory\nthrough the Meiji Restoration (1868-1912). Students will examine major\nachievements of sculpture, painting, temple architecture, and ceramics as\nrepresentations of each artistic tradition, whether native or adapted from\nforeign sources. Fundamental problems of style and form will be discussed, but\naesthetic analysis will always take place within the conditions created by the\nculture.\n\nInstructor: Wolfgram\n\nVC 73\n\n##  Seeing Systems: Critical Research as Visual Art\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first\n\nSince the 1960s, artists have increasingly used visual art to question the\nvery foundation of the world we live in. Through site-specific research and\nvisual projects, this course will teach students how to use the practice of\nvisual art to raise big questions about our world and how its systems\n(political, economic, technological, etc.) do or do not serve our best\ninterests. Students will be introduced to the work of conceptual artists such\nas Trevor Paglen, Forensic Architecture, Carolyn Lazard, and Park MacArthur,\nwho examine technological, political and economic themes through research in\norder to produce meaningful installations. Students will participate in a\ncombination of research, critical thinking, visual art making, group\ncritiques, and visiting exhibitions of contemporary artists working in the\nfield today. Previous art or art history experience is encouraged but not\nrequired.\n\nInstructor: American Artist\n\nVC 74\n\n##  Imaging Ecological Futures: Visual Art and Ecology\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third\n\nHow can art help visualize a post-carbon future? This class will look at\nenvironmental art projects over the past 50 years, from the birth of\necofeminism and anti-nuclear movements to today's artistic approaches to\nenvironmental justice. This class will research and discuss the legacy of eco\nartists, read seminal works, and engage in class discussions drawn from\ncontemporary writing on the politics of colonial landscapes and queer\napproaches to ecology. These artworks address issues of sustainability,\nextraction and marginalization that affect vulnerable human bodies and the\nnon-human world. We will then use ecological and feminist methods to create\npersonal artworks. This class will use the resources of the Huntington\nBotanical Garden, and potentially field trips for plein air works on major\nlocal energy infrastructure sites.\n\nInstructor: Segall\n\nVC/E 81\n\n##  Careers in STEAM\n\n1 unit (1-0-0) | second term\n\nA series of weekly seminars by practitioners in industry and academia working\nat the intersections of science, technology, engineering, art and design.

The class teaches\nstudents to look at film as a medium with its own techniques and formal\nprinciples. Conducted in English.\n\nInstructor: Orcel\n\nEn/VC 110\n\n##  Sinners, Saints, and Sexuality in Premodern Literature\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis class explores the history of sexuality and gender across the Middle Ages\nand Renaissance. Exploring both literary texts and visual representation, it\nconsiders how previous eras and cultures understood embodiment, sexuality, and\ngender and asks how we, as modern readers and viewers, approach these\nquestions across the distance of centuries. We will read across a wide range\nof literature, including theology, philosophy, fiction, romance, and spiritual\nbiography, and examine manuscript illustrations and other early visual media.\nQuestions we will take up include the following: how did writers and artists\nconstruct the \"naturalness\" or \"unnaturalness\" of particular bodies and bodily\nacts? How did individuals understand the relationship between their own bodies\nand those of others? In what ways did writing and art authorize, scrutinize,\nor otherwise parse the boundaries of the licit and illicit? Finally, how have\nmodern critics framed these questions? How do we approach and make use of\nearlier theories of sex and gender?\n\nInstructor: Jahner\n\nL/VC 111\n\n##  Introduction to 21st-Century French Cinema\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nL/VC 109 and L/VC 111 are taught in alternate years. This course looks at\npopular genres (comedy, thriller, animation film) and auteur cinema.

In addition to observing and photographing our own\nstarry skies, we will study 19thcentury literary, artistic, and scientific\nresponses to new understandings of the universe as dynamic, decentered, and\nlimitless. In Victorian England, picturing the universe in literature and\nrecording celestial light in photographs defied the physiological limitations\nof human observation and fueled larger debates about objective evidence and\nsubjective documentation. Prerequisites: students are required to take two\nFirst-Year Humanities classes before enrolling in Advanced Humanities.\n\nInstructor: Sullivan\n\nEn/VC 117\n\n##  The New York School of Poets\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nStarting in the early 1950s, the New York School of poets challenged the\nstuffy orthodoxy of mid-century American poetry by adopting the experimental\ntactics of European avant-garde movements such as Dadaism and Surrealism. This\ncourse offers a critical exploration of this influential group's varied body\nof work, with special attention to its extensive connections to the visual\narts. Throughout the course, we will think about the New York School's\nactivities in the context of Cold War American culture, emergent forms of\nqueer sociality, and the rapidly changing urban environment of postwar\nManhattan. Writers and artists covered may include Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery,\nAmiri Baraka, Kenneth Koch, Barbara Guest, James Schuyler, Joe Brainard, Alice\nNotley, Ted Berrigan, and Eileen Myles.\n\nInstructor: Schneiderman\n\nVC 120\n\n##  Landscape, Representation and Society\n\n6 units (2-2-2) | third term\n\nThis course examines historical and contemporary representations of the\nnatural world in art and science through a social lens. We will draw upon\ntheory and practices from art, science, geography and landscape studies to\ncritically analyze how artists, explorers, speculators, scientists, military\nstrategists, and local inhabitants use environmental imagery for diverse\npurposes with sometimes conflicting interests. The course includes projects,\nlectures, readings, discussions and a 2-day field trip. Students will learn to\nthink critically while developing creative, culturally complex approaches to\nobserving, recording and representing the natural world. Students hoping to\ncombine their course work with a research paper may sign up for a separate\nindependent study and conduct research concurrently, with instructor approval.\nNot offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Mushkin\n\nEn/VC 129\n\n##  Literature/Photography/Facticity\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\n\"It is the picture of life contrasted with the fact of life, the ideal\ncontrasted with the real, which makes criticism possible,\" insists Frederick\nDouglass. This course will take an historical approach to the relationship\nbetween literature and photography by examining what Douglass refers to as the\ncontrast between \"picture\" and \"fact\" from the advent of photography in the\nnineteenth century to our present moment. Together, we will think about how\neach medium creates images, invites different ways of reading or viewing, and\nmakes forms of individual, collective, and political representation possible.\nWe will also examine the ways in which photography and literature shape our\nunderstanding of temporality, truth, memory, and history. In addition to our\nexperience of literary and photographic works, theoretical texts on\nphotography will inform the ways of reading and ways of seeing we will develop\nin this course. Readings may include Boucicault, Douglass, Dunbar, Hartmann,\nBarthes, Lorde, and Rankine. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nVC 130\n\n##  Surveillance\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis course examines surveillance, one of the defining features of twenty-\nfirst-century life, with wide-ranging implications (from intelligence\ngathering and biometrics to social media and contemporary art), and a key\npoint of intersection between modern technology and visual culture. Though it\napplies more broadly, the concept of \"surveillance,\" from the Latin vigilare\n(\"to watch\") and the French surveiller (\"to watch over\"), originated in\npractices of looking and observation that still define many of its most\nsignificant practices today. Building on these etymological roots, we will\ntreat surveillance as, first and foremost, a visual practice and survey the\nlonger history of surveillance (and counter-surveillance) techniques as well\nas the theories that have emerged to describe its social effects, moral and\nethical stakes, and changing legal status. Not offered 2022-23.\n\nInstructor: Jacobson\n\nVC 131\n\n##  Visual Culture and the California Environment\n\n9 (3-2-4) | second term\n\nThis course examines historical and contemporary visual representations of the\nnatural world and resources in art and science through a political, economic\nand social lens. We will draw upon theory and practices from art, science,\ngeography and landscape studies to critically analyze how artists, scientists,\ncorporations, government agencies, activists, and local inhabitants use\nenvironmental imagery for diverse purposes with sometimes conflicting\ninterests. Each term will center on a specific theme related to California and\nclimate change, for example, water or energy. The course includes projects,\nlectures, readings, discussions and a 2-day field trip. Students will learn to\nthink critically while developing creative, culturally complex approaches to\nobserving, recording, and representing the natural world.\n\nInstructors: Jacobson, Mushkin\n\nEn/VC 135\n\n##  Dickens's London\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nCharles Dickens and London have perhaps the most famous relationship of any\nwriter and city in English. In this course, we will investigate both the\nLondon Dickens knew, and the portrait of the city that he painted, by reading\none of Dickens's great mid-career novels alongside a selection of contemporary\ntexts and images and secondary historical sources. We will think about the\ngap-or overlap- between history and fiction, the idea of the novelist as\nalternative historian, and the idea of the novel as historical document.\nHistorical topics covered may include: the development of the Victorian police\nforce; plague and public health; Victorian poverty; colonialism and\nimperialism; Dickens and his illustrators; Victorian exhibition and museum\nculture; and marriage and the cult of domesticity, among others. Students will\npractice both textual and visual analysis skills. In addition to written work,\nstudents should expect to be responsible for making a short research\npresentation at some point in the term. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Gilmore\n\nL/VC 153\n\n##  Refugees and Migrants' Visual and Textual Representations\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course focuses on the refugees and migrants' images in documentaries,\nnarrative films, graphic novels, fictional texts, poetic works, and\nautobiographical narratives. It investigates how these representations\nparticipate in the development and strengthening of political discourse. Works\nby authors such as Hannah Arendt, Antje Ellermann, Achille Mbembe, Martin A.\nSchain, and Sasha Polakow-Suransky will provide some context to our analysis.\nTopics discussed in class include the historical and economic relationships of\nEurope with the refugees and migrants' countries of origin, the rise of anti-\nimmigrant politics and its significance for the future of the European Union,\nbut also its impact on social peace, in France in particular. This course is\ntaught in English and satisfies the advanced humanities requirement. Not\noffered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Orcel\n\nEn/VC 160 ab\n\n##  Classical Hollywood Cinema\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course introduces students to Hollywood films and filmmaking during the\nclassical period, from the coming of sound through the '50s. Students will\ndevelop the techniques and vocabulary appropriate to the distinct formal\nproperties of film. Topics include the rise and collapse of the studio system,\ntechnical transformations (sound, color, deep focus), genre (the musical, the\nmelodrama), cultural contexts (the Depression, World War II, the Cold War),\naudience responses, and the economic history of the film corporations. Terms\nmay be taken independently. Part a covers the period 1927-1940. Part b covers\n1941-1960. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Jurca\n\nEn/VC 161\n\n##  The New Hollywood\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course examines the post-classical era of Hollywood filmmaking with a\nfocus on the late 1960s through the 1970s, a period of significant formal and\nthematic experimentation. We will study American culture and politics as well\nas film in this era, as we consider the relation between broader social\ntransformations and the development of new narrative conventions and cinematic\ntechniques. We will pay particular attention to the changing film industry and\nits influence on this body of work. Films covered may include _Bonnie and\nClyde_ , _The Graduate_ , _The Godfather_ , _Taxi Driver_ , and _Jaws_ .\n\nInstructor: Jurca\n\nVC 162\n\n##  Data, Algorithms and Society\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course examines algorithms and data practices in fields such as machine\nlearning, privacy, and communication networks through a social lens. We will\ndraw upon theory and practices from art, media, computer science and\ntechnology studies to critically analyze algorithms and their implementations\nwithin society. The course includes projects, lectures, readings, and\ndiscussions. Students will learn mathematical formalisms, critical thinking\nand creative problem solving to connect algorithms to their practical\nimplementations within social, cultural, economic, legal and political\ncontexts. Enrollment by application. Taught concurrently with CS/IDS 162 and\ncan only be taken once as VC 172 or CS/IDS 162.\n\nInstructors: Mushkin, Ralph\n\nVC 169\n\n##  The Arts of Dynastic China\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nA survey of the development of Chinese art in which the major achievements in\narchitecture, sculpture, painting, calligraphy, and ceramics will be studied\nin their cultural contexts from prehistory through the Manchu domination of\nthe Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). Emphasis will be placed on the aesthetic\nappreciation of Chinese art as molded by the philosophies, religions, and\nhistory of China. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Wolfgram\n\nVC 170\n\n##  Special Topics in Visual Culture\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | offered by announcement\n\nAn advanced humanities course on a special topic in visual culture. Topics may\ninclude art history, film, digital and print media, architecture, photography\nor cartography. It is usually taught by new or visiting faculty. The course\nmay be re-taken for credit except as noted in the course announcement. Limited\nto 15 students. See registrar's announcement for details.\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nVC 171\n\n##  Arts of Buddhism\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nAn examination of the impact of Buddhism on the arts and cultures of India,\nSoutheast Asia, China, Korea, and Japan from its earliest imagery in the 4th\ncentury B.C.E. India through various doctrinal transformations to the Zen\nrevival of 18th-century Japan. Select monuments of Buddhist art, including\narchitecture, painting, sculpture, and ritual objects, will serve as focal\npoints for discussions on their aesthetic principles and for explorations into\nthe religious, social, and cultural contexts that underlie their creation. Not\noffered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Wolfgram\n\nEn/VC 172\n\n##  Heritage and Its Discontents\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nWhat makes an old building, artifact, or custom \"historic\"? Which historic\nthings are worth preserving? This course explores the aesthetic, political,\nsocial, and environmental dimensions of cultural heritage. We will examine the\nnarratives and values associated with heritage conservation at the local level\nas well as within national and global contexts. From Caltech's own campus and\nthe Watts Towers, to the national parks, UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and the\nculinary legacy of the Atlantic slave trade, our class will grapple with the\ntheories, practices, and debates as they determine what gets preserved and\nwhich stories get told. Readings/screenings will be supplemented with field\ntrips to heritage sites in Pasadena and Los Angeles.\n\nInstructor: Jurca\n\nVC 175\n\n##  The Art of Science\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course examines the frequent and significant encounters between what\nchemist/novelist C.P. Snow famously dubbed the \"two cultures\"-the sciences and\nthe humanities-with an emphasis on forms and practices of visual culture that\nblur the boundaries between science, technology, and art. What role, we will\nask, have visual culture and visuality played in the construction of\nscientific knowledge? Taking a broad historical and geographical approach, we\nwill explore topics including representations of science and technology in the\narts and popular culture; the use of photography, illustration, and\nvisualization in the sciences; histories of visuality and visual devices; and\nthe everyday visual practices of scientific inquiry.\n\nInstructor: Jacobson\n\nVC 176\n\n##  Representation Matters?\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nOrganizations from Google to NASA are recruiting diversity task teams. College\nDEI initiatives have become a flashpoint in the culture wars. Social media\nfeeds are flooded with clickbait headlines like \"13 Queer Superheroes We Need\nto See\" and \"Disney's Ariel is Black and People are MAD!\" Everywhere, debates\nabout equity and transformation seem to turn on a single phrase:\n\"Representation matters!\" But how does representation matter, why does it\nmatter, and when did it come to matter most? Pushing beyond competing\nnarratives of 'wokeness' and 'inclusion', this course thinks through\nrepresentation as a uniquely visual formula for social change with its own\nhistory, assumptions, and limitations. Working at nested scales from national\ncontroversies (like an all-female Ghostbusters) to local case studies (like\nEast Hollywood's Flavors From Afar, with its roster of refugee chefs),\nstudents will study efforts to increase visibility and institutionalize\ndiversity across cultural contexts, and explore how communities, in turn,\nchallenge and transform identities prescribed for them.\n\nInstructor: Stielau\n\nVC 177\n\n##  Other Photographies\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nHistories of photography typically begin with the invention of the camera in\n19th century France, highlighting the key figures, movements, and themes of a\nWestern art form. At best, the Global South is an addendum to this narrative -\na place photography happens to, rather than a site of visual innovation.\nTaking an alternative approach to the canon, this course centers non-Western\nimage cultures in the history and theorization of the medium, following the\ncamera as it travels from the studios of colonial bureaucrats in Rajasthan\nthrough the struggle against South African apartheid to Tunisia's smartphone\nrevolution. Adopting a global and comparative lens, students will read classic\nworks of photographic theory alongside anticolonial philosophy, fiction, and\nart manifestos, exploring how a familiar medium has been repeatedly re-\nimagined and re-invented to suit new contexts and meet new needs. Ultimately,\nwe'll ask how widening our field of view can expand our understanding of\nphotography, shifting how we read images more broadly.\n\nInstructor: Stielau\n\nH/HPS/VC 185\n\n##  Angels and Monsters: Cosmology, Anthropology, and the Ends of the World\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course explores late medieval European understandings of the origins,\nstructure, and workings of the cosmos in the realms of theology, physics,\nastronomy, astrology, magic, and medicine. Attention is given to the position\nof humans as cultural creatures at the intersection of nature and spirit; as\nwell as to the place of Christian Europeans in relation to non-Christians and\nother categories of outsiders within and beyond Europe. We will examine the\nknowledge system that anticipated racializing theories in the West.\n\nInstructor: Wey-Gomez\n\nH/HPS/VC 186\n\n##  From Plato to Pluto: Maps, Exploration and Culture from Antiquity to the\nPresent\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | second term\n\nThis course covers a broad range of topics in the history of maps and\nexploration from Antiquity to the present. These topics range from the\nearliest visualizations of earth and space in the Classical world to\ncontemporary techniques in interplanetary navigation. By way of maps, students\nwill explore various ways in which different cultures have conceptualized and\nnavigated earth and space. While maps emulate the world as perceived by the\nhuman eye, they, in fact, comprise a set of observations and perceptions of\nthe relationship between bodies in space and time. Thus, students will study\nmaps, and the exploration they enable, as windows to the cultures that have\nproduced them, not only as scientific and technical artifacts to measure and\nnavigate our world. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Wey-Gomez\n\n"

        "content": "Wr 2\n\n##  Introduction to Academic Writing\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | first term\n\nThis course offers a focused introduction to the practices of reading,\nthinking, and writing that characterize academic writing. More specifically,\nthe course teaches students how to articulate a position, situate writing\nwithin specific contexts, engage with the work of others, locate and provide\nconvincing evidence, and understand the expectations of different types of\nacademic readers. Students will take several writing projects through multiple\nstages of revision, improving their work with feedback from seminar\ndiscussions, workshops, and frequent one-to-one conferences with the\ninstructor. Students are placed in Wr 2 based on a writing assessment that is\nrequired of all incoming students; successful completion of the course is\nrequired before taking first-year humanities courses. Enrolled students may be\nrequired to take Wr 3, 4, and/or 50 in subsequent quarters.\n\nInstructors: Hall, Schneiderman, Sherazi\n\nWr 3\n\n##  Reading and Composing Academic Writing\n\n9 units (1-0-8) | second term\n\nThis course builds on Wr 1 or 2 for students who need additional instruction\nin both the core concepts and practices of academic writing before beginning\ntheir first-year humanities coursework. The course will focus on developing\ncritical reading skills and composing successful academic essays. By taking\nseveral writing projects through multiple stages of revision, students will\ndevelop a deeper sense of their strengths and limitations as writers, and\nseminar discussions, workshops, and frequent one-to-one conferences with the\ninstructor will equip students to address those limitations. Not available for\ncredit toward the humanities-social science requirement. Enrolled students may\nbe required to take Wr 4 and/or 50 in subsequent quarters.\n\nWr 4\n\n##  Principles and Practices of Academic Writing\n\n3 units (1-0-2) | second term\n\nThis course follows Writing 2 and offers an opportunity for more focused study\nand discussion of core concepts in academic writing, such as audience, genre,\nargument, working with sources, and process. Weekly readings offer concrete\nguidance on these topics, and class discussions expand on that guidance,\nproviding insights into common challenges college writers encounter. Not\navailable for credit toward the humanities-social science requirement.\n\nInstructor: Hall\n\nWr 50\n\n##  Tutorial in Writing\n\n1 unit | first, second, third terms\n\nBy permission only. Individualized tutorial instruction in writing and\ncommunication for students who benefit from weekly discussions about their\nwork as writers. Not available for credit toward the humanities-social science\nrequirement.\n\nInstructor: Hall\n\nEn/Wr 83\n\n##  Personal Narrative and STEM Research\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course focuses on personal narrative and memoir writing by STEM\nresearchers. STEM research strives for objectivity and replicability, and key\ngenres of STEM research writing require that writers repress their\nsubjectivity and individuality. However, a researcher's experience of inquiry\nis often deeply personal and emotional, and some researchers choose to write\nabout those experiences in personal essays and memoirs. We will analyze a wide\nvariety of this narrative writing, and we will examine connections between the\nnarratives' formal features and the rhetorical effects they might have on\nreaders. Drawing on what we learn, students will compose an excerpt of their\nown memoir or a stand-alone personal narrative essay. The course will also\nexplore current approaches to spoken storytelling sometimes utilized by\nresearchers, such as the Moth story and the TED talk. Satisfies the Institute\nscientific writing requirement and oral communications requirements for\nstudents in all options.\n\nInstructor: Hall\n\nEn/Wr 84\n\n##  Communicating Science to Non-Experts\n\n9 units (3-0-6) | third term\n\nThis course offers instruction in writing and speaking about science and\ntechnology for non-expert audiences. Instruction focuses on how to convey\ncomplex technical information in clear, engaging prose and speech in a variety\nof contexts. Readings in different genres (e.g., the newspaper discovery\nstory, the op-ed, the personal narrative, the explainer talk) raise issues for\ndiscussion and serve as models for assignments in these genres. The workshop-\nstyle nature of this course relies on drafting and revision in response to\npeer and instructor feedback. Satisfies the Institute scientific writing\nrequirement and the option oral communications requirement for humanities\nmajors. Not offered 2024-25.\n\nInstructor: Hall\n\nESL/Wr 107\n\n##  Fundamentals of Scientific Writing\n\n6 units (3-0-3) | third term\n\nThis course aims to provide a strong scientific writing foundation for\nmultilingual or international graduate students through guided instruction in\nacademic STEM writing. More specifically, it teaches graduate students about\ncomposing texts in scientific English for various audiences, focusing on\nissues of clarity, as well as grammar and usage. It helps familiarize writers\nwith the features of clear and effective STEM writing, and it teaches writers\nabout the style and genres of U.S. academic STEM writing, helping them learn\nto read and write about the work of others in their field. Students are\nencouraged to take ESL/Wr 107 in the first or second year of graduate school.\n\nWr 109\n\n##  Writing and Publishing Research Articles in STEM Fields\n\n6 units (3-0-3) | summer term\n\nThis course focuses on strategies for composing an academic journal article in\na STEM field. The rhetorical purpose and form of each section of the journal\narticle will be considered in depth. The course is intended for graduate\nstudents who are prepared to be a lead author on a manuscript. While the\ncourse will cover strategies for collaborative writing, students will be asked\nto draft sections of an original journal article based upon their own\nresearch. The course will also provide guidance for preparing a manuscript for\nsubmission and responding to feedback from peer reviewers. Clarity in\nscientific writing and creating effective figures will also be discussed.\nCourse enrollment is limited to 15 students.\n\nInstructor: Burkett\n\n"
